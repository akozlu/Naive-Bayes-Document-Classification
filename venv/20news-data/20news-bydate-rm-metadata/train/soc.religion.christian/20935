[In response to some of the discussions on the Sabbath, Andrew Byler
commented that if we really followed sola scriptura we would worship
on Saturday -- the change to Sunday was a law made by the Church, and
we don't acknowledge its authority to make laws.  I noted that
Protestants do not consider Sunday worship a law.  --clh]

He was not referring to the FAQ but to the five Sabbath Admissions posted
on the bible study group.  This is what prompted someone to send the FAQ
to me.

n> ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.

You cannot show, from scripture, that the weekly Sabbath is part of the
ceremonial laws.   Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.

Can the churches also decide what is and is not sin?  Interesting.  Where
there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of
operation.  But we cannot be as creative with what God has explicitly
spoken on.
