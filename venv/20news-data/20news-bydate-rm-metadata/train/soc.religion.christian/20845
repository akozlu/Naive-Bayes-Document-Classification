	Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person.
The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago
(as were all of the "holy" books). Follow the parts that you think are
suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't
take it literally.

	So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist?
The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in
my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are 
intrinsically good (as against Christ's "we are all sinners").
 Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken 
ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism. 
(In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist).
But to "awaken" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat?
Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday?
Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? 
Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing
to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think 
Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a 
philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). 
Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion
(compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very
probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.
(There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the
middle east at the time of Christ).
And perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out ("woman was created
after man, to be his helper" etc).

other brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an
1-800 number to turn in your pledges.
God it seems is alive and well inside these boxes.
