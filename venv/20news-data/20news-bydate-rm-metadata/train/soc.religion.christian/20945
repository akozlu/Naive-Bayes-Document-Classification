I'd be fascinated to see such evidence, please send me your article!
On the negative side however, I suspect that any such simplistic link
    abstinence-education => decreased pregnancy,
    contraceptive-education => increased pregnancy
is false.  The US, which I'd guess has one of the largest proportion of 
"non-liberal" sex education in the western world also has one of the highest
teenage pregnancy rates.  (Please correct me if my guess is wrong.)
