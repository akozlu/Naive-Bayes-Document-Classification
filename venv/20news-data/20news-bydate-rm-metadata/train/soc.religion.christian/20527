So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that
AIDS is "deserved" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from 
sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail.
I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided 
the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation.
If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do
we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.

To willingly judge "others" as deserving punishment seems to me
to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.  
 

So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in
"deviant" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS
of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be
infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors,
many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors
carry the risk of transmission.  
 

The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing
daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so
I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate,
IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.
