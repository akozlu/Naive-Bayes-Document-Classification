I've sent the article.  In terms of the group discussion, I wanted to point
out that "non-liberal education" (head in the sand) is not the same as
"abstinence education".

We had "non-liberal education" regarding drugs when I was a kid in the 60's,
which didn't do us a lot of good.  But "abstinence education" regarding
drugs has proven effective, I think.
