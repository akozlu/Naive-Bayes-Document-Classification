  You haven't fully explained the atheist position.  Many theists believe that
there is "no proof of the existence of God" but choose to believe in him
anyway.  I haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be
broken down to unprovable assumptions.  This isn't a problem with me (everybody
needs to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a "purely 
logical" argument for the nonexistence of God, I'd really like to see it.



  Ahh...but when you use science and reason, you have faith in certain beliefs
of the scientific method--for example:

  The physical laws of the universe are stable.
  Our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth.
  Objective reality exists.
  Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.
  
  Can you prove any of these?
