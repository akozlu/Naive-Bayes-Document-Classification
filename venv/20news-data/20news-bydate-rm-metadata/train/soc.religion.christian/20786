I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes
"true" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially
about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on 
Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person.
But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity
IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the
Branch Davidian "cult" from the Presbyterian "church"?  Doctrinal
differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as
an answer.

	"But God demonstrates His     "The Lord bless you, and keep you;
	 own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you,
	 while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you;
	 Christ died for us."	       the Lord lift up His countenance on you,
				       and give you peace."
