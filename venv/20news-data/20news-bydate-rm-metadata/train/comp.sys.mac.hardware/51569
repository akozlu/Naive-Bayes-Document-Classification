Noooooooo!  I've been servicing Macs for years too, and I've had to
repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way.  It's
rare, but it does happen.

Mind you, this doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  The parts that can
blow (the ADB power fuse and RF filter) aren't too expensive, so IF you
have a someone around who can do component-level repair, it may be worth
the risk (especially if you're around Seattle, 'cause you might get to
pay *me* to fix it :-))..  On the other hand, if your only repair option
is the Apple-standard logic board swap (major $$$$), you should probably
play it safe.


SCSI: yes, ADB: yes, Floppies: yes...  They can all cause trouble.
