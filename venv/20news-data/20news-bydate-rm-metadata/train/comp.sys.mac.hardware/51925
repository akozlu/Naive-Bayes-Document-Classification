Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the
warranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications, near
Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))
and a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne,
and every piece (the serial cable, the telephone cable, etc.) had AT&T 
part numbers on them, except the QuickLink software package and the 
CompuServe intro kit.


If anyone's interested, Logos number is (800) 837-7777.  I ordered mine
last Wednesday and got my modem on Friday, though it's not to far from
Cleveland to Pittsburgh.. :-)  On the down side they only ship UPS COD.
