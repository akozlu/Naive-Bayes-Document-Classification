long
disk


I don't know how many times I've posted this the net.  No one EVER
listens.  

Once and for all:  Floptical Media is only $1.40 a megabyte if you don't
know where to buy it.  I am bying my flopticals at $30 per 2 disks.  I
see that as $.75 a meagabyte, NOT $1.40.  No, I'm not buying in bulk, I'm
not getting a special deal.  $.75 a meg is good in my book, Approching
floppy price.

Any questions on my source can be sent to ctr@po.cwru.edu.
