Not Quite the point to be considdered here!
Fact: If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time 
of release) then you will see shortly afterwards Apple no longer producing 
Hardware...Look at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens.
Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper 
else where! (Heck we can get a Sun Workstation cheaper than a Quadra, and 
infact we have a number of times!!!, it ALL comes down to $$$$)

them,
It


No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is 
to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't 
happen!), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE 
hardware platform.

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the 
temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much 
for Apple! (50 million copies @ $100 is SERIOUS money!).
