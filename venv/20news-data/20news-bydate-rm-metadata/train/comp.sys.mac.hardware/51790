The DayStar PowerCache for the SE/30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated
CPU plus the powercache.  This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card.
Currenty, DayStar does not have the '040 in this configuration, but it is
due out early next year.  With their upgrade policy, you can get the '030
accelerator now, and when the '040 version becomes available, you get
credit
for the one you have.  

I am running their 50 MHz version with FPU along with a Radius Precision
Color Pivot and I'm very satisfied.
