Who knows... I just quoted what was "written" in SCSI Director...



I've tried calling Transoft Corp about this and have either gotten the
response "Huh?" to "Yep" to "Nah"... You would expect that a damaging state-
ment like this would have _some_ "data" to back it up...

Anyone want Transoft's phone number?
