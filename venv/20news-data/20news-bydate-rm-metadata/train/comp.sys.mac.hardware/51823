    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an "option."
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.
