  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure).
  Ethertalk card on-board
  Audio in/out
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots.
  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.

In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more.
