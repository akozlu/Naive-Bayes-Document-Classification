I have got a dot matrix printer that came with a Lisa (I think) I wish to attach it to a PC, but have no manual. I have been told that it is some sort of C.Itoh printer in disguise. Can anyone help with manuals or info about codes to send to select fonts, italics etc. I want to write a printer driver for Protext.

Thanks in advance
