I like it a lot. It is worth the additional expense. The only problem I
found is with MS Word (5.1a). If you have a table the is longer than
a page and the cells have a visible border, the last (bottom of page)
line on the first page will be missing. It makes no difference how
the table is formatted. The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's
page view or page preview.
