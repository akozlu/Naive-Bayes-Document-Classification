I'm sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck-and-neck for 
crunch-power, but for a given clock speed, how do we rank the
following (from 1st to 6th):
  486		68040
  386		68030
  286		68020

While you're at it, where will the following fit into the list:
  68060
  Pentium
  PowerPC

And about clock speed:  Does doubling the clock speed double the
overall processor speed?  And fill in the __'s below:
  68030 @ __ MHz = 68040 @ __ MHz

Thanks very much.  I'd appreciate hearing any further explanations
from any experienced folks out there, too! 

 
P.S.  Folks have been having trouble replying to me lately with the "reply"
      command.  Try typing my address by hand and it should work.  Thanks!
