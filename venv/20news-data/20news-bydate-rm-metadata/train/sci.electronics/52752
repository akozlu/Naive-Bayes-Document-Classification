	Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than
most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least)
all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at
much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase'
of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use
transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).



	Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are
a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections
at a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns
are available in the $150 range, and so are the little
twiddle-stick manual types ($15).  For a modest project, of
a couple hundred connections, I'd prefer to borrow a professional
AC unit... or a pneumatic one.
