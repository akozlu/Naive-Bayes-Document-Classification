Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.

Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer 
saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago.

Byeeeee !
