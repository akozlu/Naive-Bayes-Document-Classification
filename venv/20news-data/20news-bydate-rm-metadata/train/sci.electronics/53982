Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now
to actually count pins.  there are two varients, SMD  and
SMDC (I think), only minor differences between them.  Widely used
prior to the advent of SCSI for large drives (or all drives) on minis
(and mainframes(?) no experience on those).
