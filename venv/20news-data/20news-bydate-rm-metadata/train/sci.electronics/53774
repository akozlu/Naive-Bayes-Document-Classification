Last week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with
my Sun CD-ROM drive. It turns out that the channel I was testing with
was burned out in the amp. The other channel works fine.

So now I need a new amplifier chip. My local Radio Shack no longer
carries components! The chip is a 12 pin SIP (?) labelled with BA5406
and then "502 515" below that.

Does anyone have a source? Thanks,
