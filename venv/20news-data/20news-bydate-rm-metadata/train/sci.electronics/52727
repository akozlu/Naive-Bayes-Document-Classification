BUT... If you are in the habit of trying to repair old and obsolete
machines, the old data books are a goldmine of information you can
not get anywhere else. If you are trying to find a modern replacement
for an obsolete part, the original specs really come in handy. Design
out of the new books but save the old ones (or donate them to a ham).

If anybody in Phoenix disagrees, I'll drive over and help them 'get rid'
of all their old data books.
