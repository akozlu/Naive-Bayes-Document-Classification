For some reason the name Grayhill springs to mind -- saw something
like that in a Grayhill catalog, along with options for custom printed
overlays and a neat little electroluuminescent backing that would make
the whole shebang glow a nice shade of green ..

mighty handy if you're trying to key a door combination in the dark
and don't want to TURN ON THE &%#$!! LIGHT ..
