GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in
satellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out.
I think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended
for use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common 
implementation - it may not be in volume production.

The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite
standards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those
in the US - so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver
designs to find out what's in common use.
