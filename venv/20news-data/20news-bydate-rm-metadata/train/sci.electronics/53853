Now, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW
PeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls
the rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down.

My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's
astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with
the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the 
distributor pickup.  Very poor design.

I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing
to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is
wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting
out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference
between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are
usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation
when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when
you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details
and addresses).
