I haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not  
sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in  
the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  
a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)
