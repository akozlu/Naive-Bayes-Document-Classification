The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  
I realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
His ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
living, I have heard . . ..

So what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  
that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  
is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???
