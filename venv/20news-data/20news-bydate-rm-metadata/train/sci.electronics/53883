Can I suggest the University of Western Australia in Perth.
The weathers great, the people are great and our Electronic Engineering department is great.
I am a first year student here ... so I don't know much about what projects but I do know they have a good reputation in the fields of dsp and communications.  Ever heard of QPSX?  The people who own are ex-UWA ... so that gives an indication of what the department is like.

For more information
email: yianni@swanee.ee.uwa.edu.au
with the above request and he should be able to tell some more info

or write

Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering
University of Western Australia
