I've seen them in surplus stores.  All they are are fluorescent bulbs 
without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass).  I've
also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC
socket, probably not what you want.


As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near
the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope)
exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a
friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.

Hope this helps.

Dave.
