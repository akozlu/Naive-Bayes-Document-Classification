Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent
toner, like HP's "Microfine" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output,
but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior.  

On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much
worse than a bubblejet. :-)

One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good
looking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets.
