We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have
_mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit),
various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select
lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.

Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.

Second sourcing may be a problem though :-(
