What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface
Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes
for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.
