You are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on
TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  Of course,
the phrase "TV screen" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.  Might
even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).
