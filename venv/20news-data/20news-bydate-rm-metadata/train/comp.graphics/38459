I think you are too optimistic! PostScript is a very big language and
so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary
ps code. The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is
IslandDraw.
I for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files (converted to
epsi format). Small changes then are possible (erasing some letters,
adding text and so on).
