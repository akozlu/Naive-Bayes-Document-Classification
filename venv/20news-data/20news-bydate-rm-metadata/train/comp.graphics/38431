Why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? Assuming an ARM
is about as efficient as a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations, doing
a Compact-Video-like digital video codec is an easy task. For Software
Motion Pictures (which is a lot like Compact Video, though it predates
it), we get 48 frames/sec. at 320x240 on a DECstation 5000/200. That
machine has a 25 Mhz MIPS R3000.
