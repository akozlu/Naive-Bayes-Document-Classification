I've used that reference, and found that I needed to go to their
original tech report:

	Maureen Stone and Tony DeRose,
	"Characterizing Cubic Bezier Curves"
	Xerox  EDL-88-8, December 1988

This report can be obtained for free from:
Xerox Corporation
Palo Alto Research Center
3333 Coyote Hill Road
Palo Alto, California 94303
+1-415-494-4440

The TOG paper was good, but this tech report had more interesting details ;-)
