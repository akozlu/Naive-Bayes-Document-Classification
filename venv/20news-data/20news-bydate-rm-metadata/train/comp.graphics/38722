Am I glad you write that. I got flamed all along because I begged NOT to
crosspost some nonsense articles.

The problem with crossposting is on the first poster. I am aware that this
posting is a crossposting too, but what else should one do. You never know
where the interested people stay in.

To split up newsgroups brings even more crossposting.
