Hi there,


It might be that the X terminal doesn't support the "Postscript
Extensions to X" product.  I use the 'dxpsview' program on a 
DECstation 5000 to view postscript files but when I moved to an
NCD X terminal, I couldn't use it any more.  So I ftp'd and
compiled GhostScript (GNU software).  Now we can view postscript
files on our X terminals.

Hope this helps.

Grant
