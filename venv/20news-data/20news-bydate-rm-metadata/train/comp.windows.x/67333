Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated
8 bit PseudoColor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and
thelike to run. I strongly suppose you to emulate at least:

  should not make big misfits
  pixel indices, conversion stuff. Furthermore, you should run your default
  screen on this visual.
