You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt.
USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the
position and size.

You say: "Tom, don't blow a gasket, what's the harm?"

Some window managers do very different things (besides positioning the window)
when they see USPosition rather than PPosition.
