When I run our RS6000's "info" utility through a remote login
  shell (rlogin) from my Sun Sparc 1+, I can no longer type
  lower case in any of info's window prompt's.

  I thought the prob. may have been due to my Sun window mgr. 
  (Openlook) being incompatible with the AIX Motif application
  but I tried it under TVTWM also.  Same result.
  
  So this is presumably an X11 key definition problem between 
  workstations - but my system admins. feign ignorance.
  
  What do I need to do the be able to type lower case into 
  this remote AIX motif app. from within my local Openlook
  window manager?
