Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells
allocated in the default colormap?

e.g.   colormap = DefaultColormap(mydisplay, myscreen);

The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells(mydisplay,
myscreen), but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be
much less than this, depending on the color requirements of the windows
currently in place. I'd like a way to determine this number. Thanks in
advance!
