As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).
