Hello Everybody!

I have a little question:

Due to more features (PEX, Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for
example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver.
X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my
question:

Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free
memory available to the Xserver?

So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the
CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).

Please reply via e-mail, I'll summarize!

Sincerly,
        Matthias
