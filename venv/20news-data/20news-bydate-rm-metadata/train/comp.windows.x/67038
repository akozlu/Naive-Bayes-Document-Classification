I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple "open-draw-quit" client.  

As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the "window_redraw()" (or whatever) directly?  Although, depending
on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press.
