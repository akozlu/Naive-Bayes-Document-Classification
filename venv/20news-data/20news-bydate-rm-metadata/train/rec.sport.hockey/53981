Press conference at 1PM ...


Interestingly, Keenan's co-coach (or is it his "Number One"?) on Team
Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen.  

It'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's
contract to be Keenan's assistant ...  Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players, just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks
of 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those
Canucks last May ...
