On 20-Apr-93 in Don Cherry - Coach's Corner..

This clip was shown on local news in Pittsburgh last night (KDKA), complete
with animated sarcasm by the sportscaster.  It's the second time Cherry
has been shown on local Pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks.  Both
times he was blasting Lemieux.
