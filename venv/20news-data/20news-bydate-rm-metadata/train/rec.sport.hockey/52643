Linares has not defected; as I pointed out, MLB requires that the player
defect first.


What a surprise.  As long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all
teams, MLB won't let a few teams sign it.  Seems perfectly reasonable to
me.  


Except that MLB won't allow it, which is all I ever said.
