Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect
of:
"You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask 
and he can't stop a beachball!"

You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard
it.
