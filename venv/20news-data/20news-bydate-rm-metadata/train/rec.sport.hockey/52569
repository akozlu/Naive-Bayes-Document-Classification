Are you comparing Cullen to Salami?  I would say that that is valid.  If
Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami
stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end?



Excuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just
barely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an
awful lot like Salami's +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well
off - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in
Finland claim he is capable of.  But if he did that he wouldn't be chal-
lenging for the league lead in goals would he?  The Bi-Planes might be
challenging for first however...


Now let's see...you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen.  Who's
next?  Mike Foligno?



Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style
of contribution would be more conducive to winning.  Or don't you 
think so?



I don't believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly hadn't
read this far).

It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your
contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren't
trying to be merely argumentative.
