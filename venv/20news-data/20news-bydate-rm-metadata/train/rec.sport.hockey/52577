Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago...


Manson, by his own admission, had a terrible year...the Oilers
don't really have a team MVP...by default, it should go to Craig
MacTavish.  Shjon Podein was the biggest surprise...Tikkanen the
biggest disappointment.


Tinordi was back by mid-season last year...and when he plays he is the MVP.


King had a great year last year also.


How can Kovalev be a surprise?


Fence-sitting...look at Philly's record with Eric and without...
there is no doubt.  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.


Tocchet had a near 100 point season in Philly with Mike Bullard as
his center...why shouldn't he be able to do that with Mario?


Really Joseph deserves the MVP nod.
