Really?  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot?  They
couldn't even beat the Whalers in two games!

(Well, since you're a Pens fans the whole question is moot.  I think
the teams most likely to beat the Pens are the Bruins, Nordiques, and
Blackhawks but I don't think they can really do it.  :-))
