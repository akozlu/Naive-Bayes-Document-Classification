There's quite a few Wings fans lurking about here, they just tend
to be low key and thoughtful rather than woofers.  I suppose every
family must have a Roger Clinton, though.  But remember (to paraphrase
one of my favorite Star Trek lines), "if we adopt the ways of the Leaf
fans, we are as bad as the Leaf fans".
