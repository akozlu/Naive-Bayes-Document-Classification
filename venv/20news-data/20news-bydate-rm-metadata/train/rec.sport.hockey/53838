No problem, no offence taken ...


It is sad, just as a lover of the sport, that this team can be in
the metro New York area for over a decade and still exist as just
a non-entity ...


We're getting the Sabres-Bruins as the replacement game (and probably
so are you) while the Devils-Penguins game is played on SCNY and the
Islanders-Caps are the overflow game on the SCA (SCNY Plus).  If the
Sabres-Bruins ends early then we'll go to the Devils-Penguins game
(assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last
minute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks
ago).  ESPN's coverage started last night, by accident, but as one
or more other writers have pointed out, they could've gone to wild
hog wrestling for the evening instead ...
