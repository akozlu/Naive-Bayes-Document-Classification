I think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed.  Lemieux
two, Tocchet, Mullen, Tippett, and Jagr.  I buzzed my friend because I forgot
who had scored Mullen's goal.  I said, "Who scored?  Lemieux two, Tocchet,
Tippett, Jagr."  The funny part was I said the "Jagr" part non-chalantly as
he was in the process of scoring while I was asking this question!!! :-)

All in all ABC's coverage wasn't bad.  On a scale of 1-10, I give it about
an 8.  How were the games in the Chi/St. Louis/LA area???


That's stupid!!!  I'd complain to the television network!  If I were to even
see a Pirates game on instead of a Penguins game at this time of the year, I
and many other Pittsburghers would surely raise hell!!!


Texas is off to a good start, they may pull it out this year.  Whoops!  That
belongs in rec.sport.baseball!!!
