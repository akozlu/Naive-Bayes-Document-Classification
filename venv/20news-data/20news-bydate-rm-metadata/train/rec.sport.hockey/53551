First, I enjoyed reading your post.  Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak
spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has
had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and 
leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of 
respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason 
concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the
fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates
that they are playing better team defense.


We'll see.  It'll be fun.
