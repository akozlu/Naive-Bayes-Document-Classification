It sounds to me like it's just SCREAMING OUT for parody.  Give a copy to your
friendly neighbourhood SubGenius preacher; with luck, he'll run it through the
mental mincer and hand you back an outrageously offensive and gut-bustingly
funny parody you can paste over the originals.

I can see it now:

                               The Stool Scroll
         Thoughts on Religion, Spirituality, and Matters of the Colon

                       (You can use this text to wipe)
