So?  Kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member?

Even in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents ARE NOT
gang-members.


How was it obvious?  Were they not trying to hit the target?  Or, does
Kratz confuse "marksmanship" with "trying to simulate a post"?  If so,
that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand
that that exclusion would be an error.  (It excludes a lot of legit
"gun games" as well.)


Sounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how a
self-defense shooter might well practice.  The only things that action
excludes are hunting and "like a post" shooting.  Kratz should get out
more often.
