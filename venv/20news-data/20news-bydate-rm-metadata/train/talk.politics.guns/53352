Yes, You state the reference, and then YOU claim it's a good or fair treatment.  


You fail to see the differences between absolute numbers and rates.

No, you just miss the point.  By your methods, I can prove gun control to be a  
total failure.  New York's total homocide count, with it's strict gun control,  
is MUCH higher than Rhode Island's, with it's less strict gun control.  FAR  
more folks are killed in New York, than Rhode Island.  Therefore, according to  
Mane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than  
Rhode Island.  Remember, it's "Nitpicking" and "a whiney debating style" to  
point out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat  
my argument.


Now you agree?  Wow, a break-through!
