Why don't you call the City and ask? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun
ban as well, but does allow those with a "collectors FFL" to possess
("collectible?") handguns.


Probably a fine in practical terms.


It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident
in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a
handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,
a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend
himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA
Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided
not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs
has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his
house, and told him: "this is stepping over the line; this could get
dangerous for you." Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers
watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief
and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.


L.V. Cipriani states that the "Any other weapon" category is allowed,
but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular, which I
believe is in the "Any other weapon" category and a chopped barrel
H&K HK-94 (Class 3 for sure) is not clear to me...


In your dreams, buddy. As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois
residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians
get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry
concealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes
out of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois 
Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.

anti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney 
Jack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called "Republican."]
