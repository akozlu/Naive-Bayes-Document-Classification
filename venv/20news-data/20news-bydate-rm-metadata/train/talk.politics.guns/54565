That's a revisionist account of what happened.  Gritz was well-aware
of Duke's presence on the ticket.  Given that Gritz is not at all shy
about associating and promoting other white supremacists (such as the
Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto), whatever reasons Gritz
had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke's presence.


I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with
a photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke.
