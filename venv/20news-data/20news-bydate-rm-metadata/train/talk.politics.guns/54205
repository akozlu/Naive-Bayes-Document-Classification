Ah I love posts like this.  Many people have already replied to this one as I
knew they would.  I'm not going to say much as this just seems like baiting to
me.  Someone decided to post to see how many people would get mad and reply.  I
am just going to ignore it but I do have one thing to say.  See below.

Listen buddy, if you're going to quote Star Trek get the quote right.  It was
"Resistance is futile".  Get it right the next time :-)
