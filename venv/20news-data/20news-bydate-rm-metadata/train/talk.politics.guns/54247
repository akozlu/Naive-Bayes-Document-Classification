I have the April 15, 1993 issue of the SF Chronicle in my lap.  Page
E7 (in the "Sporting Green" section) has a Trader's advert.  (The
copy is a bit screwed up - it says that the prices offered expire
4-14-93, but the ad is there.)

The SF Examiner and Chronicle run the same set of adverts (because
they have a joint printing/biz agreement and differ only in editorial
content).

I've seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially,
albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.

I don't know about the other papers.

Does Traders claim that things are changing?  When?


Because it's easier than telling the truth and no one much cares
either way.


Before you do, make sure that the bozos are actually doing what
you're accusing them of.
