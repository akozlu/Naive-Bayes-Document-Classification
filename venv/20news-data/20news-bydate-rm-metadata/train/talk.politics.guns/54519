No it's not.  If you would have read my other post I was accurate.  Here's what

[material from another post]------------------------->  The other point that I
would like to make because I know it's true (looked this one up in the Illinois
                  this is for you Andy-----> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
statutes before) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in Illinois.
^^^^^^^^ <------ Also for you Andy.

And then I went on to say:
There is no such thing as a CCW for us ordinary folk here.
[end of quoted material]

Of course I forgot to mention who "us ordinary folk" are so just for Andy I'm
going to go to the library tomorrow and photocopy the part of the Illinois
statutes with this information and post it.  Ordinary citizens CAN NOT get a
license to carry a concealed weapon.  There are very few people who can.  I
even asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain people
can get licenses for concealed carry.  He couldn't remember which people but he
knew for sure that regular citizens couldn't get that type of license.  He told
me to go check at the library for the statutes which I did.  I'll post that
info tomorrow night.  Until then.......
