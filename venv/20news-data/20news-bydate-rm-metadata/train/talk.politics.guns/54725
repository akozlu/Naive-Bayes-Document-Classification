Not to mention that the G-men believed the children didn't have gas masks.

But that was not, with respect to the children, the point of the gassing.
The feds *knew* that the children's health would be in danger and proceeded
under the assumption that the "motherly instinct" of the Davidian women
would remove them from harm's way. I busted a gut on that one.

Someone else on the net observed that the administration's appeal to a
woman's "motherly instinct" would never wash with feminists and liberals
if a republican were in the White House. I say that such an justification
could *only* come from a feminist mindset. 

BTW - I'd read in the paper yesterday that the type of gas used was CS2.
The paper didn't provide any specifics about it.
