Medical info without a name/body attached is completely useless for
treatment.


Thus making it as secure as cash, for some purposes, but far less
secure for others.


Sure they do.  The prospective sitter may have a nasty habit of molesting
kids three or four months into the job.  The references may not have
known him long enough or may not have picked up on this yet.

Remember, criminal conviction info is public, so if you're going to
argue for an ID card, other people are going to have a strong argument
that it disclose public info.


Thus making it useless for negative information.


Yeah right.  How are you going to keep doctors from spilling the
beans?  (We already know that you can't keep cops from disclosing
info, but at least that info is typically supposed to be public
anyway.)


The article discusses technology, not appropriate policy.  It also
fails to deal with "what happens if the folks with the secrets blab".
