Nope.  Here in Northern California, a newspaper recently did a survey,
asking if people favored stricter gun controls.  A full 40% said no.
Here, in one of the most Liberal (it wasn't always a swear word :( areas
of the country, nearly half the people don't want additional controls, let
alone revocation of RKBA...


Misguided dolt though he may be (though, I still maintain, less dangerous
than Bush), Clinton does not publicly support revoking the second amendment.


Well, I'll help MY neighbors...


Violent solutions are passe'?  I take it you propose disarming the police,
then?

Please don't mention RKBA in the same breath as the KKK.  RKBA is about
being able to defend yourself and others, not about killing the innocent.
Actually, your mention of the KKK is rather funny, considering that the
first gun control law in the US were created specifically to disarm black
people...
