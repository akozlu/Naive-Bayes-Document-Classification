BDs would have committed suicide, but maybe not until hunger and thirst gave them
the choice between sucide or surrender. 
The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance to
surrender and get a fair trial. No matter who started the fire, the BDs were 
responsible for 80+ peole dying. No one else.
