Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible
trio who allegly represent me.  Instead, I wrote to Bentsen.  My letter
was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach
was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew
there were kids).

Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to 
me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However,
I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.


This section is not in the letter that I received.  The parts about ATF
logo and steenking badges or their loss of the element of surprise
were not included, either.


The same guy with the bad handwriting apparently signed my letter, "for
Richard L. Garner; Chief, Special Operations Division".
