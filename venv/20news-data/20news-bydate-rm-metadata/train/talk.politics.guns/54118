	If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more
	difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation. 
	The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military
	in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.

	In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into
	this country has greatly decreased. This is because its
	value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or
	heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.
	Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on
	the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and
	thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer
	is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.
	You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a
	good dollar/pound deal.
