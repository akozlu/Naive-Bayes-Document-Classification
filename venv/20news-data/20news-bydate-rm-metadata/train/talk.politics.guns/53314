Of course, if you're a criminal, or hang around with criminals, or
flash large wads of cash in the wilder parts of town, or utter verbal
bigotry in the right public places, your chances of being shot are much
higher.

Avoiding these behaviors, on the other hand, decreases your chances of
being shot.

Something like 60% of all murders are criminals killing criminals. 
Over 90% of murders are committed by people with a prior *known*
history of violence.

Simplistic moral, suitable for my three year old, and most inane
posters:  "Bad people do bad things - repeatedly."
