CNN just claimed he bought 104 "semi-automatic assault rifles".  And
they say Koresh wasn't god-like...  He managed to buy or build a
collection of fully-automatic semi-automatic rifles...  Quite a feat,
I would say.  ;-)

They're still making charges of "sexual abuse" and such, or course.
Nobody seems to have noticed that the Treasury department has nothing
to do with sex crimes.  Or maybe the feds have recently instituted a
TAX on sex crimes...  Yeah, that's why the BATF was there, looking for
unregistered *guns* ("this is my weapon, this is my gun, this is for
fighting, this is for...").


I also heard that they're claiming to be cautious because of Koresh's
"heated ammunition stockpile".  I seem to recall that smokeless powder
tends to decompose at even moderate temperatures.  I would be rather
surprised, after a fire of that nature, if *any* of his "stockpile" is
unexploded, or unburned.


I seem to recall that aluminum powder is a common component of
fireworks...  The folks on rec.pyro could probably tell you.


I think *anything* is legal if you have the proper license.  If he had
a "curios and relics" permit, I believe he could legally own
handgrenades to go with his launcher.
