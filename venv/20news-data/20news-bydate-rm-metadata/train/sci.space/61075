Called "gas".


The balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced
some air resistance.  When they were finally punctured, this 
preasure (and the internal preasure that was needed to maintain
a spherical shape against this resistance) caused them to
catastrophically deflated.  The large silvered shards
that remained were easily visible for some time before
reentry, though no longer useful as a passive transponder.
