Your suggestion to learn something about "the perversion of Judaism"
from someone you claim has experience in Israeli intelligence and the
PLO is like a suggestion to learn something about the conspiracy of
Sesame Street from someone with experience in fashion design and
pizza-making. 


"Judeo-Nazism"?  CPR, you're in a league with Barf Shmidling himself.
You can take that as a compliment, if you see it that way.
