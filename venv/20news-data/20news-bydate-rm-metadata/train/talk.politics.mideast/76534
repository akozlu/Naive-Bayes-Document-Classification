The ADC is an organization of Arab-*AMERICANS*.

Let me see...you're saying that "most if not all" Arab-AMERICANS should be
spied on?  You're also saying that "most if not all" Arab-AMERICANS
should be views as a national security threat to Israel (and the US, 
as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing, in 
which no Arab-AMERICANS were involved)?  By inference, can we assume 
that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses 
a threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on?

Perhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention the
Rosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied 
on by the ADC.

Oh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so 
convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have 
no wish confuse you further.


So the LA times reporter who had information about him
sold to the South African government was involved in "anti-Israel
activity or propaganda"? Are we to infer that the simple act of
reporting an event in a newspaper constitutes "anti-Israel
activity or propaganda"?  Or was it South Africa?  The LA 
times reporter was based in South Africa, after all.
