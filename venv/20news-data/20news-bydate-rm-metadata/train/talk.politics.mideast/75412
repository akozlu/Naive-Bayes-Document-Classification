Contrary to what the "Protocols of Zion crowd" might suggest,
Judaism does not have any such goals.


The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer.
I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical
one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling
is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or
Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.
With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights
in Israel as do all other Israelis.


Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think
you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their
supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my
knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,
as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens
of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli
citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find
themselves.
