As one who was born in Quebec and worked in Montreal, I feel I must
defend the reputation of McGill University. It is a fine, old,
creditable institution of higher learning.

Thus, I can only assume that some under graduate student left his/her
terminal on-line and the janitor has been getting access to it.
