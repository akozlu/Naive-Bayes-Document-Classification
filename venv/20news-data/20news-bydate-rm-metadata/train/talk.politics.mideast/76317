Israel, where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by
Hamas "activists."  A neutral organization might also report that
Israeli arabs have full civil rights.

	Terrorism, as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
you to stand up, is random attacks on civilians.  Terorism includes
such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a
boat because he happens to be Jewish.  Not allowing people to go where
they are likely to be stabbed and killed, like a certain lawyer killed
last week, is not terorism.
