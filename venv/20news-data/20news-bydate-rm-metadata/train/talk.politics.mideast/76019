	That's true. Israeli ID cards do not identify people
	as Israelies. Smart huh?



	Yes. There's one warhead in my parent's backyard in
	Beer Sheva (that's only some 20 miles from Dimona,
	you know). Evidence? I saw it!

	You're welcome. Now, let me ask you a few questions, if you
	don't mind:

	1. Is it true that the Center for Policy Research is a 
	   one-man enterprise?

	2. Is it true that your questions are not being asked
	   bona fide?

	3. Is it true that your statement above, "These are indeed 
	   provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
	   people around me" is not true?
