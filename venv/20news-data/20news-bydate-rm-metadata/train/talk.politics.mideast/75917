    Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands 
    of Arab death merchants, I see nothing wrong with the advice.


    As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes
    through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who
    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going
    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's
    suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to
    terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case
    of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was
    this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give
    up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your  
    biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?


    A laudable precaution.  
    
    Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray
    Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an
    integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents
    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are
    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The
    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.

    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you 
    have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable 
    sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing 
    but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude 
    against Israel and the need to vent it.
