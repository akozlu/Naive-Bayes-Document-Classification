 	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday
 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that.
 	``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told
 Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
 ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-
 Herzegovina.
 	Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for
 what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of 
 ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of
 civilians.
 	``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact
 that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones
 and we ought to pick a couple.''
 	Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the
 former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have
 a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.
 	Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to
                     ****************************************************
 the radical Islamic government of Iran.

O, I C!
   Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged
  eastern town of Srebrenica.
  	``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they
  could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry
  around Srebrenica,'' Biden said.
  	``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have
  saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred
  right now.''
  	Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the
  equation,'' Biden said.

  	Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm
  for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia-
  Herzegovina.
