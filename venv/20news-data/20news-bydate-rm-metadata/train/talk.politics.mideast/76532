	And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syrian
troops controlling the country.  Until Syria leaves, and free
elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese
would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.


	I expect you will agree that the same holds true for Syria
having no right to be in Lebanon?



	The UN also thought Zionism is racism.  That fails to make it true.


	They lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those
tanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in '73.  There is little
evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.

	They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled
kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are
usually picked up in the morning.



	Nonsense.  Israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the
negotiating table for 40 years.  It was the gulf war that brought the
arabs to the table, not the Israelis.



	Nonsense.  According to Arafat, Israel must be destroyed.  He
has never come clean and denied that this is his plan.  He always
waffles on what he means.

	``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in
	this part of the world.  Our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated...''
	--- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79
