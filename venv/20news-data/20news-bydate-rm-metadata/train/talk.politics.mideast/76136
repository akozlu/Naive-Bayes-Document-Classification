There is a very narrow margin of stupidity between accepting my references and
those of the Greeks, and you just said you'd rather do the latter! That's fine
with me. I was sincere in my offer, but this saves me the effort. It doesn't
take a half-brained man to go to any library and check out a bunch of sources
of decent objectivity. Just ask a good friend for help. !:-)
