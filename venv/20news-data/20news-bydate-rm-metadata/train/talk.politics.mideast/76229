Ending an embargo does not _we_ must sell anything at all.


You seem to oppose ending the embargo.  You know, it is difficult for Europeans
to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place.


But if this was the reason, and if furthermore both sides are equal, wouldn't
all us racist Americans be favoring the good Christians (Serbs) instead
of the non-Christians we really seem to favor?
