Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of
2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But 
most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern
his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish
people in 1914.


     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'
      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), 
          "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.)


I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does
not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of
what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,
decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping 
out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive 
ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and 
not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We 
cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to 
keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because 
of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims 
of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, 
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.
