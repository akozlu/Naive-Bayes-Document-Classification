Some of your article was cut off on the right margin, but I will try
and answer from what I can read.

Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but
Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who
Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing
in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity
and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views
and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each
religion.


We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are
paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are
poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most
often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims
around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human
sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money
and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid
(and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer
services)).

God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere,
God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not
say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where
he has not/.

The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that
the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same
message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the
Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed
their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the
personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the
same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know
that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed
to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which
were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later
such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.


Only God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if
that happens, it was the will of God.

Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what
you said.  And yes, may God help us all.
