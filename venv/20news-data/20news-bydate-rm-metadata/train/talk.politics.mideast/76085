The Litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does
not run through the buffer zone.  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan
but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been
no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to
climatic changes in rainfall.
