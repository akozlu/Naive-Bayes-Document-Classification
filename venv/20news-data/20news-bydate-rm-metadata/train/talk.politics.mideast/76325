Anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking
his/her sources does not deserve to be believed.  The Gaza strip does
not possess the highest population density in the world.  In fact, it
isn't even close.  Just one example will serve to illustrate the folly
of this statement:  the city of Hong Kong has nearly ten times the
population of the Gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area.  The
centers of numerous cities also possess comparable, if not far higher,
population densities.  Examples include Manhattan Island (NY City), Sao
Paolo, Ciudad de Mexico, Bombay,... 

Need I go on?  The rest of Mr. Davidsson's message is no closer to the
truth than this oft-repeated statement is.
