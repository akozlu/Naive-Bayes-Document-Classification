If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda, then 
consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda
too.  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion?  I
wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either.  Unless you want to provide
some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism, I suggest you 
keep your mouth shut.  I'm sick and tired of all you anti-semites comparing
Israel to the Nazis (and yes, in my opinion, if you compare Israel to the Nazis
you are an anti-semite because you know damn well it isn't true and you are
just trying to discredit Israel).
