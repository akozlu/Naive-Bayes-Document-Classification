Ok. My Aykut., what about the busload of Greek turists that was
torched, and all the the people in the buis died. Happened oh, about 5
years ago in Instanbul.
	What about the Greeks in the islands of Imbros and tenedos, they
are not allowed to have churches any more, instead momama turkey has
turned the church into a warehouse, I got a picture too.
	What about the pontian Greeks of Trapezounta and Sampsounta,
what you now call Trabzon and Sampson, they spoke a 2 thousand year alod
language, are there any left that still speek or were they Islamicised?
	Before we start another flamefest , and before you start quoting
Argic all over again, or was it somebody else?, please think. I know it
is a hard thing to do for somebody not equipped , but try nevertheless.
	If Turks in Greece were so badly mistreated how come they
elected two,m not one but two, representatives in the Greek government?
How come they have free(absolutely free) hospitalization and education?
Do the Turks in Turkey have so much?If they do then you have every right
to shout, untill then you can also move to Greece and enjoy those
privileges. But I forget , for you do study in a foreign university,
some poor shod is tiling the earth with his own sweat.
	BTW is Aziz Nessin still writing poetry? I'd like to read some
of his new stuff. Also who was the guy that wrote "On the mountains of
Tayros." ? please respond kindly to the last two questions, I am
interested in finding more books from these two people.
