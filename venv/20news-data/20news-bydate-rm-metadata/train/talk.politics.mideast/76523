	Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)
	are their homeland. Can't you see the
	the  "Great Armenia" dream in this? With facist methods like
	killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the 
	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to
	escape the from Lacin, a city that was "given" to the Kurds
	by the Armenians. 



	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes
	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities
	announced that they were going to search these cargo 
	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.
	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of
	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not
	humanitarian aid.....

	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.
	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
	it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons
	since it's content is announced to be weapons?
