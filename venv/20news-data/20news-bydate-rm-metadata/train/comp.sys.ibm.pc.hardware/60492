 Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to
 leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're 
 putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.
  Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.
 You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,
 etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save
 a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't
 look like much when it come time to fix your computer.
