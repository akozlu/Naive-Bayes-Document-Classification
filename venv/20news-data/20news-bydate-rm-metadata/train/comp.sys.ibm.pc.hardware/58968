1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs.

2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.

3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.

4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse
   or other int`s when diskaccesing.

(I get 2.3MB/s with DX50 LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXT340SY - Coretest)
(I get 1.3MB/s                                              - Sysinfo)
