We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the
time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the
offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some
of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the
offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.
