I just bought an actix graphics engine 32 plus with 2 megs.  

I am not impressed...

I have been having all sorts of problems with the board.  Various lock-ups
in windows, problems with the screen not centering, no flexibilty in choosing
synch rates for a monitor, buggy windows drivers, lack of 1024x768x64k driver,

If anyone else has one of these cards, please e-mail me...

Looks like i'm going to try the ati ultra plus...
