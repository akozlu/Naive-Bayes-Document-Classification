My brother is in the market for a high-performance video card that supports
VESA local bus with 1-2MB RAM.  Does anyone have suggestions/ideas on:

  - Diamond Stealth Pro Local Bus

  - Orchid Farenheit 1280

  - ATI Graphics Ultra Pro

  - Any other high-performance VLB card


Please post or email.  Thank you!
