: I'm looking to buy a 17" monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide what
: monitor I should buy. I have a MAG 17S (this is a .25 dpi version and it using
: a TRINITON tube) and a NANAO 560i in mind.

Good luck finding an MX17S.  When I was looking around back in
December/January, Mag wasn't producing any because they couldn't get
tubes from Sony.  I asked when they expected to restart production as
I was willing to wait a few months to get an MX17S but they said not
any time soon.  I wound up getting a T560i and am extremely happy with
it.
