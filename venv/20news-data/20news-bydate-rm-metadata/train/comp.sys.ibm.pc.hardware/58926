While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the
sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,
it is only "relatively" recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,
mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.
If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixes/releases.

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the "right" person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting
addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the
Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond.

               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.
