there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called
'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things,
amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller
commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.

it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector
headers etc.   by setting sector size to something very large (like
8K).
