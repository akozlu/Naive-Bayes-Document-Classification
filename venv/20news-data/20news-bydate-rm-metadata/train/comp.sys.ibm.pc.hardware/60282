    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?
    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time
    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.
