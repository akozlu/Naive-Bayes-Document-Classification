What group is this?  This is not a MAC group.


Why the spec list again?  We are talking SCSI on a PC, not on a MAC or
a UNIX box.  And we are talking ISA bus, or possibly EISA or VLB.

This isin't comp.periphs.SCSI.
Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC
with an ISA (or EISA or VLB) bus.

Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate.  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the 40 megs/sec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast, but the PC isin't one of
them.
