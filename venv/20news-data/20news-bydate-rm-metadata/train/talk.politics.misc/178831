I'm sorry about your friend.  Really.  But this anecdote does nothing to
justify the "war on drugs".  If anything, it demonstrates that the "war"
is a miserable failure.  What it demonstrates is that people will take
drugs if they want to, legal or not.  Perhaps if your friend were taking
legal, regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the
position he's in now.
