I know it's a minor point, but, gee, dude, you have no idea what economic
and political principles I adhere to.  But don't let that stop you--you're on a
roll.  Just ascribe to me whatever you want--I know you'll choose wisely.
After all, I *do* believe in personal responsibility.



Duh.  What else would you *expect* a socialist to do?




(a) Just when and where have I encouraged people not to be responsible
for themselves?  Be specific--but do make up random dates and heinous
acts as you see fit.

(b) You and I have encouraged many people to do many things.  How does that
in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions?  Is there
a finite amount of responsibility, so (cf. conservation of energy) as
I become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual
perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so?  At what point does the
perpetrator become completely innocent altogether?  You know, this lends
a whole new meaning to the term "the moral high ground".




I will pass the info on.  Out of curiosity, what kind of jobs would these
be?  What's the demographic mix wrt race, age, culture?



Life's a bitch, ain't it?  Man, you've got to get out of Fornicalia--have
you considered someplace perhaps geographically distant but politically
more friendly to you, like, say, Indiana?  Or maybe Utah?



I don't doubt it, but unless you can show me statistics to the contrary
I will persist in my apparently dogmatic socialist belief (hey, if *you* say
so) that most AFDC money really does--for better or worse in the long
term--feed FDCs.
