AAAAAAAAAAAA!  RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!



Then why are they in the process of systematically dismantling some of
their socialistic health care systems through privitization of key components?


If I hold a gun to your wife, would you respond the same way? I don't
think so. While the age of aquarius may have hit the White House, the
age of peace love and harmony hasn't hit in South Central LA nor has it
hit in former Yugoslavia. And as long as there are people in the world
who would rather see me dead than thrive, I want the protection of a
police force who will keep the peace so I *can* make love without being
shot.


The ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis
have forgotten) is "I do not care if you are either a man or a woman,
I do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay
or straight." Once you can honistly say "I do not care about color,
race, or gender or sexual preference", then we will truly be on the
right track.

Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along?
Get real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female,
or whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour.

But the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend
money, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly
say "I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences;
I instend instead to treat you as a human being," crap like last year's
riots will continue to happen.


Barf.

You mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sake
of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is
no wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in
real life?

Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapter
of that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there
in chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:

	"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,
	especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently
	the province of individuals who create new inventions and
	discover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this
	book that there is no wealth creation.

	"We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,
	however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently
	unpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume
	no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical
	economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid
	as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested."

So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now
assuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an
idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple
things.

To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience
building bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical
physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.
