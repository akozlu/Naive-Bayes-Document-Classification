Hello, is there anybody in there?  You think you have to pay for this idiot's
problem now, who's going to pay for the ballooning number of addicts and 
all of the associated problems with them.  I don't even want to think about
it with Hillary in the White House and an administration that "feels our
pain".

No harm but to himself?  What about when he drives his school bus full
of kids into a train.  When he gets stoned and drives up on a sidewalk
and kills 5 people.  When he lives off me on Welfare for the rest of his
life.
