I'll answer you're sarcasm with more sarcasm:

	Boy, it looks like the WOD is WORKING REALLY GOOD to stop people from
	being screwed up in the head, given that example!

(Issue: your friend _got_ his drugs--legal or not legal, he'll continue to
get them.  Issue #2: why should _I_, as somebody who does NOT use illegal
drugs and who IS NOT "screwed up" have to PAY for this idiot's problems?  He's
not doing anybody any harm except himself.  The WOD, on the other hand, is an
immediate THREAT to MY life and livelyhood.  Tell me why I should sacrafice
THIS to THAT!).
