Unless I've got my notes mixed up, 939 F.2d 499 comes close to this.
Regular guy.  Blue-collar worker at a regular company.  Hauled into
court.  Convicted.  Appeals to 7th circuit.  Makes all the right
arguments (his brief is cited by Mr. Teel as an example of a
"winning" brief).  Shot down, 3-zip by the 7th circuit.  Appeals to
the Supreme Court.  And...

...Certiorari denied.  Defendant goes to jail.  Oh well.
