    Nationwide, the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50%, but
    it is reportedly as low as 10% in some inner-city neighborhoods.
    I bet more than 10% kids living in such neighborhoods are already 
    covered by Medicaid.

    Here in Massachussets, we have had a universal immunization program,
    the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing, for many years (two decades?).
    Mass' immunization rate is 65%.  What about the other 35%?  I guess
    some parents are indeed too ignorant or too lazy , or simply do not 
    care.
