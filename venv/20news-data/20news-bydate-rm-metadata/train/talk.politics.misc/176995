Fine.  If you think it's an expose of corruption and fraud, 
please prevent a jury question.  Don't just reassert your 
opening statement.



No indication that was what happened until now.  Editing down is 
always possible.



It would be interesting to hear who the responding parties are.


FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY:

Don't let the IRS see this, Mr. Teel.


And, as has been noted more times than we care to count, about as 
likely to stand up in court as the twenty-seven eight by ten 
color glossy pictures the Stockbridge, Mass., police, took for 
use as evidence against Arlo Guthrie.  (As anyone who knows 
Alice's Restaurant is aware, he pleaded guilty to littering, was 
fined $50, and told to pick up the garbage.)

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."
