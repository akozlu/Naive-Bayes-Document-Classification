In case you missed it on the news....the first 16 Haitians
of many that tested positive for HIV and were being held on a
base in Cuba have been flown to the U.S.
     Further a U.S. judge has ruled that they must receive
medical treatment or be returned to a place where they could
receive same.

      So guess what folks, we taxpayers get to pick up the tab 
(just as you might have expected) for people who have never
contributed a dime to the U.S. society.
