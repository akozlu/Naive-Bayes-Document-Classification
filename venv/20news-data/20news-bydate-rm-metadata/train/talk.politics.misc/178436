Exsqueeze me?  I saw *your* original post in alt.discrimination.
Your post was cross-posted to three groups.  My followup was cross-posted
to two of those three (omitting soc.motss).

Now, instead of engaging in meta-discussion off the topic, could you answer 
the question posed?  If your statement is so "beign"(!?), you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query.
