	You misunderstand.  I'm not trying to prove a *cause* for anything. 
Merely pointing out that Ted's assertion that the "blip" in revenues was
"caused" by selling to avoid the tax can't be proven.


	Not disputed.


	It works for any situation.  If you believe the market is going up,
don't sell.

	If believe it's not, sell.  But then you'd be selling anyways, wouldn't
you?

	So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided
that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out?

	There isn't any.

	Ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is "proof" of
that proposition, but I'm saying you can't know that the trend of increasing
capital gains revenues wouldn't account for a lot of that increase.
	1986 was the height of the housing boom, remember.  People were
"trading up" like mad.


	Indeed.
