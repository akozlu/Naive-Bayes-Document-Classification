Gordon Banks:

This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is
a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to
be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not
put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise
more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the
extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but
smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid
that this method will stop working someday, but usually
I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.
This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion
of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
(that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle-
dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.

I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward
keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.
