Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well
as induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could be
due to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* produce
a splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). She should definitely see a rheumatologist.

Since you don't mention skin disorder, anemia, or joint pain you'd probably
rule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma.
