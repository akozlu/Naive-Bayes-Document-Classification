Why do you think Steere is doing this?  Isn't he acting in good faith?
After all, as the "discoverer" of Lyme for all intents and purposes,
the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't
see the ulterior motive here.  It is easy for me to see it the
those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything.
There is a lot of money involved.


Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't
necessarily make you the most objective source of information
about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you
may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people
who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research
on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you
can be very effective there.
