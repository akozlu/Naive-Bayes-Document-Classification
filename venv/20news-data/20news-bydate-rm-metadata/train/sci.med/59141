So antihistamines can cause weight gain.  NOW they tell me. :-)
Is there any way to find out which do & which don't?  My doctor
obviously is asleep at the wheel.

The original poster mentioned fatigue.  I had that too, but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having -- I wasn't getting
any rest.  My doctor said that was a common reaction.  If astemizole
doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, how does it cause that side
effect?  Any ideas?
