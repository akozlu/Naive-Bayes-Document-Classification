Maybe, maybe not.  A new graduate would obviously be well trained (but
perhaps without sufficient experience). A radiologist trained 10 or
15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a 
whole 'nuther matter.  A OB who HAS trained in modern radiology technology
is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to 
the former.


If the radiologist is also trained in OB/GYN, why not?
