The only fungus I know of from California is Coccidiomycosis.  I
hadn't heard that it attacked bone.  It attacks lung and if you
are especially unlucky, the central nervous system.  Nothing new
about it.  It's been around for years.  THey call it "valley
fever", since it is found in the inland valleys, not on the coast.
