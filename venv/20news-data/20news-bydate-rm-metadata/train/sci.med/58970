The FDA, I believe.  Rules say no blood or blood products donations
from anyone who has been in a malarial area for 3 years.  I was a platelet
donor until my Thailand trip and my blood bank was very disappointed
to find out they couldn't use me for 3 years.

Not necessarily.  The same rules may not apply to organ donation
as to blood donation.  In fact, I'm sure they don't.
