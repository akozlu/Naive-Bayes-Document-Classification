Infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now.  You
are seeing a pediatric neurologist, aren't you?  If not, I strongly
recommend it.  There is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called
felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms.  As
for learning more about seizures, ask your doctor or his nurse about a
local support group.
