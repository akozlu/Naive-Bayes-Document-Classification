There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled
"Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil".  The article states that research
has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with
AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement
seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients
who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.
