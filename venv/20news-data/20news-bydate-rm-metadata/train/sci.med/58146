In fairness, we should note that if you look up "speculum" in the
dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first
definition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
optical instruments."

Which doesn't mean the name fits in this context, but it's not as far
off as you might think.
