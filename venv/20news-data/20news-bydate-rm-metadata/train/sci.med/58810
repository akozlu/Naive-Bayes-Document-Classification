=Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One
=slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know
=he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized
=swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,
=however, because that's not written in their little rule book.

Of course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  Could be your brother is
reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock
in other people.

Similarly, Chinese food isn't just MSG.  There are a lot of other ingredients
in it.  Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't
normally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately conclude
that any negative reaction is to the MSG?

=I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad
=reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

I'd be surprised if some of these reactions weren't due to other ingredients.
