Food poisoning is only one of the many possible causes. Yes, even other people
share the food. 

Boy, you computer people only know 1s and 0s, but not much about logic. :-)

No. I did not said MSG was not the culprit. What I argued was that that
there was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG.  

If you want to convict MSG, show me the evidence, not quilty by suspicion.


Nobody is forcing you to change what you believe.  But I certainly don't
want to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him/her
sneeze. That is exactly what some anti-MSG activitiests are doing


Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant.
I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last
name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.

What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from
a recent FDA hearing:

           ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect
on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is
``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate
has made them sick.''

And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double
blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also
had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.

Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group,
some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG
emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything. 

My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably
20-1 outnumbered.
