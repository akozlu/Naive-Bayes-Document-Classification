   It's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as
   a double-blind study on the effects of MSG, by
   virtue of the fact that MSG changes the taste of food in
   a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and
   that cannot be duplicated by a placebo.

Common! You can easily disguise  to flavor of  MSG by putting  it in a
capsule. Then,  the  study  becomes  a  double  blind of  MSG capsules
against control  capsules (containing exactly  the same contents minus
the MSG).
