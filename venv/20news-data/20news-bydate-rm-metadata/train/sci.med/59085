Good grief again.

Why the anger?  I must have really touched a raw nerve.

Let's see:  I had symptoms that resisted all other treatments.  Sporanox
totally alleviated them within one week.  Hmmm, I must be psychotic.  Yesss!
That's it - my illness was all in my mind.  Thanks Steve for your correct
diagnosis - you must have a lot of experience being out there in trenches,
treating hundreds of patients a week.  Thank you.  I'm forever in your
debt.

(oops, gotta run, the men in white coats are ready to take me away, haha,
to the happy home, where I can go twiddle my thumbs, basket weave, and
moan about my sinuses.)
