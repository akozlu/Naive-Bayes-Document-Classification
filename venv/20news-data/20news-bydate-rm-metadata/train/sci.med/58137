Dangerous only to immune suppressed persons and fetuses.  To them,
it is extremely dangerous.  Most of the rest of us have already had
it and it isn't dangerous at all.

Cat feces are the worst.  Pregnant women should never touch the litter box.

Cook your meat.  Watch it with pets.

You'll have to read up on it.  


There is an effective antibiotic that can keep it in check.
Of course, it can't reverse damage already done, such as in
a fetus.
