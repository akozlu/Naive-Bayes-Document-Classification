Ming-zhou Liu's main problem is that he has an incompetent
physician -- himself.  This physician has diagnosed a problem,
even though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease
before and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present
similar symptoms.  This physician now wants to treat his first
case of this disease without any help from the medical community.

The best thing Ming-zhou Liu could do is fire his current
physician and seek out a better one.
