If I remember rightly PKU syndrome in infants is about 1/1200 ? They lack
two genes. And people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 persons?
Those with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. And those
who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to
be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame. 

The methol, formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating?
