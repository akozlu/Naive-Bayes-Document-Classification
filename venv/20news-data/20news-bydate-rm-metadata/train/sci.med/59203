Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis.  
Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has
now changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with
and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be 
important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and 
I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing
them, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories
and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.
