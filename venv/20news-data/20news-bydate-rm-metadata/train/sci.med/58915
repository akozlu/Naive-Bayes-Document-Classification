Blood glucose levels of 40 or so are common several hours after a
big meal.  This level will usually not cause symptoms.


If you mean "reactive" hypoglycemia, there are usually no symptoms,
hence there is no disease, hence the dietary recommendations are the
same as for anyone else.  If a patient complains of dizziness,
faintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after
a big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals.
