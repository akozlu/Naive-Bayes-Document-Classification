I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don't
know why.  Perhaps because they weren't as profitable as cafergot.
Too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients
and they don't do any good flushed down the toilet.  I suspect
we'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal
spray, which is far more effective.
