Snort.  Ah, there go my sinuses again.


Oh, wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey, they laughed at Einstein, too!


Yeah, I'll bet.  Tomorrow, the world.

Listen, uncontrolled studies like this are worthless.


I'm sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric/hypochondriac who
responds to "miracle cures."


Yeah, "it makes sense to me", so of course it should be taken seriously.
Snort.


Yeah, "it sounds reasonable to me".


Oh, really?  _What_ tests?  Immune-compromised, my ass.
More like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome.


You know, it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused
in this way.  It's ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic.
The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.


The only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap
and when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any
systemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without
any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use
IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve
the "yeast" problem once and for all.


Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating
your symptoms.

Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket?  I'd hate
to think my insurance premiums are going towards this.
