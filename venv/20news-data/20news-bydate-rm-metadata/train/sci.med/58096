 
I agree. Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up
money that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work
such as doctors and nurse, and supplies.  The most efficient system
is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such
as England's or even Canada's.  I'm afraid we are on the wrong
track.  The problem may be that the insurance lobby is too powerful.
