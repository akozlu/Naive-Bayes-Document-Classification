If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process.  Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of.  Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby?  If you wouldn't, then why would you want a OB/GYN to
read your ultrasound study?


In my opinion the process should involve a OB/GYN and a radiologist.
