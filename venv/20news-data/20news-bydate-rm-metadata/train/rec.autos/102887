                   ^^^^^^^^^^
I have a 92 Wrangler Sahara and paid $14.1 new (including the rebate).

                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After driving a CJ-5 for 6 years, that fancy stuff is pretty nice.

          ^^^^^^^^^^^
I like my Wrangler, but when doing some serious off roading, it can't
keep up with a CJ-5 because of ground clearance and limited suspension
travel.  I do have a winch and would like to get an ARB air-locker in the
future.


I love the 4.0.
