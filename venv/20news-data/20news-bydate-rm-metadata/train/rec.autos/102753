  Well, before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of
braindeads for this... 
  My 1979 Mercury Capri had this lovely feature. This was not the earlier
German variant but the newer one that was identical to the Mustang of 
current fame. I can't tell you how many times this feature pissed me off.
Come to think of it my brothers Zepher had this as well.
