How can car be any good that has

          S     N     A    C
             U     D     N    E

written on the back with crooked letters as if a 2-year-old had
written it?  Hehhehehehahaha!

(About as silly as Crysler's attemps to make the label on the back
of some of their other cars appear like they are Mercedes.)

Sorry, I couldn't resist...
