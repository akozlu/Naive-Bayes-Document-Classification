(I deleted your name because I don't want to sound accusative in my remark)
I'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons, but I would ask you if 
you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
alarm?  I can think of worse things in the world.  Glad you got out of there
before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun.

We can all ask "what's happening to society these days", but don't forget to
ask another important question too: What effort am I expending to make it any
different than it is?
