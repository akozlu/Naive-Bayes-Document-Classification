The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the "continental
kit." The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside
mounting bracket; a continental kit is a very specific ornament/storage
compartment. (The 1941 Continental has a neat trunk; it looks rather
like a laundry hamper, IMHO. :-)
