Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies. There is
little or no chance that they are the same. The Manta went through several
generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time.


Not true. The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years.
The LeMans (old Kadett) is only the latest version.

Different Cars. One looks like a sports-car, the other is a coupe.
