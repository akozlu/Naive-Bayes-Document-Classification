Sounds more like an Opel GT.  Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through
Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it
was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.
