  I own a new ford Explorer, I really love it!
I drove the Jeep and besides the power I just didn't see
spending the money for it! The Jeep was great but I just
love the Explorer! I have a 2WD and I got through the blizzard 
of 93 just fine! I drove about 400 miles in the worst part of    
storm and it never faulterd!     My own Opinion
