diamond star cars (Talon/Eclipse/Laser) put out 190 hp in the turbo models,
and 195 hp in the AWD turbo models,  These cars also have handling to match
the muscle, and are civil in regular driving conditions, rather than having a
harsh, stiff ride....The AWD Turbo is clearly the better choice of the two
(because of all that torque steer on the front drive model), but you may have
to go with a leftover or "slightly" used model for that price range....tough
decision...
