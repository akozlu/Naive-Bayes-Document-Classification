[stuff about Dodge Shadow deleted]


What do you mean by "all models", all models of cars, all Chrysler models,
all models that the fleet manager had bought? Because there is no way in
hell that the Shadow is the most reliable car of all models sold, not
even Chrysler's dept. of lies, damned lies and statistics would claim that.
