rites:
something near the suburbs, people do at least glance over.  Remember, an
alarm is only a deterent, not a prevention.  If a thief sees two cars he
"likes", one has an alarm and the other doesn't, he's obviously going to skip
the alarmed car and avoid the hassle.  There is a way around every alarm, but
at least you've got SOMETHING on your side.....
