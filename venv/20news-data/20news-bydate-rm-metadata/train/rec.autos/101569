Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.
