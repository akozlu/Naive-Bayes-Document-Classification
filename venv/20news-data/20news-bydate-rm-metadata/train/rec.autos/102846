In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.

Sunny California is a 1.6l wagon based on Sentra.
Avenil is a 2.0l 4WD/2WD wagon .(It looks like Infinity G20 
but actually it's independently designed to be a wagon.I mean, it's 
not based on any sedans.) 
 
Nissan had better consider to sell them here.



Sounds nice. But I doubt they have a plan. Coz Avenil was introduced 
to replace any sedan based wagon.
