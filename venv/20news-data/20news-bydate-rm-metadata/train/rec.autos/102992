Hmmm....I was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly
enough, an Honest-to-God Expert(tm); it's amazing what he knows...), 
and he said that, based on his conversations with the inventor of 
Slick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of 
conflict), he avoids it like the plague.  He does recommend other 
teflon-based/type oil additives, though.
