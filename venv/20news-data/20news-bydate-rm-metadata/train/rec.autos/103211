nice theory.  too bad the MR2's never came with a four cylinder over 2.0
liters.  More like 1.6.  Or did they? were the nonturbo MR2II's  2.2 or
some such?

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders, must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented design..like Porsche's 3.0 I4...
