Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at
the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where
God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an
1984 Camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to
blow the horn.  The only time I got it right was when I was getting the
annual state-required safety inspection!
Not one of Ford's better ideas.
