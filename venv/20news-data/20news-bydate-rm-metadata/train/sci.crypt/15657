	I really like these claims. Where did they come from? We hear,
practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can
crack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack.

	Where do people get these fascinating facts? 'The Puzzle Palace'?
If you can get it for a buck, 2nd hand, it must be true, eh? I'm pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality
cryptosystems to a variety of places. I don't recall reading anywhere
reliable that they're supposed to:

	1) Monitor my phonecalls.
	2) Monitor usenet.
	3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack.
	4) etc etc.

	This is not to say that they *don't*, they might. But you don't
know that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost
all values of you. It follows, therefore, that for most values of 'you',
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia.
