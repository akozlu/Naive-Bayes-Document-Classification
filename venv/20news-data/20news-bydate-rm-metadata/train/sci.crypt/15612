Imagine if this were available during the 1992 elections; instead of
clumsily searching through the Clinton passport file, they could have 
just done a "voice-grep" (as someone stated earlier) on his telephone
conversations for the last 10 years.

I'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV, but intuitively there's
something wrong with having one's words archived for possible future
use against you.  This possibility frightens me more than any of the
talk about the Clipper Chip, right to cryptography, etc.


I'm afraid it just might.
