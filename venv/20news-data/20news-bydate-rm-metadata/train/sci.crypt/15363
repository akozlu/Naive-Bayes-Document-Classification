A lot of us out here in the hinderland will trust the Japanese
before we'll trust the NSA, the President, or those stupid
Fortune 50 companies you're so proud of.



And since the Japanese corps aren't part of our "government/governors"
they may be more trusted out htere than you are.


People are getting tired of this "be patriotic, do whatever we say
without question, and pay more taxes" attitude that comes from
America's political party...
or should that be caste?
