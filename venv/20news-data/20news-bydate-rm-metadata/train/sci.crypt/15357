  And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
black market. And in the US, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless
activities.  It doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist,
power and control are central to government. Since citizens can't be trusted to
run their own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for their
own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!>
start to hide things from the IRS, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and
that cannot be allowed!)
