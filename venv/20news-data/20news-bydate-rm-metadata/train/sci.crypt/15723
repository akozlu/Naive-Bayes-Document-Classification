I am testing IDEA block cipher implementations for correctness
and needs some golden test vectors.  I've looked through
the postscript IDEA chapter but the single example gives me
zero degrees of freedom.  I'll contact the inventor if necessary
but since we are NOT paying him money for use of his invention,
I'd like to offload this from him.  Anybody got vectors?
(No disease vectors, please).
