Just a question. 
As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes
with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition
for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)
