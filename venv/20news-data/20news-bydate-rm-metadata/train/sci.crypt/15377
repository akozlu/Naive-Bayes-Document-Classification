								Yeah!

	The algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar
government equivalent to military) has been let for this "proprietary"
design that the Feds say that NSA developed.  Is there a patent?  Is that
patent publicly available?  My betting is that that too is classified.

	If the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it would
compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip
users cypto-data but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker.

	Wouldn't that just be too bad?
