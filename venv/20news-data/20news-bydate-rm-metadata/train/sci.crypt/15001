People have been encrypting notes in their notebooks for hundreds of years
-- maybe over a thousand.  It's a long tradition dating at least back to
the alchemists.

I know of nothing bad happening to them.  I would assume that nothing bad
would happen to you, given this long history establishing encryption as
the property of individuals, to do with as they please.
