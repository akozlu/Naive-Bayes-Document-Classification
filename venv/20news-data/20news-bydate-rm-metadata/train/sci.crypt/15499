Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do
with the design, implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind
any "moves" being made using this chip as a pawn.

Remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not
the case that all the Republicans, etc. in the NSA and FBI and CIA
immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
Democrats.  Most of the government -- say, 96% -- is appointed or
hired rather than elected.  Since this Clipper device has been in
production for over six months, it probably has little or no 
foundation in the currently elected Democratic Executive body.


Could be.  However, the sky hasn't fallen yet, Chicken Little.
