You are so correct - Clinton did not initiate it.  He just cast it in
GRANITE by implimenting, NOT stopping the DECISION.  I also stated in another
post I don't give a damn what administration does it, I still find it
totally unacceptable, and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats
ought to be run out of office.

Also, Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights.
Clinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard.  That reveals a total difference
in philosophy.  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people
control.  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it, no real security
for the common person, and no ability to defend oneself against illegal
attack, from whatever source.  "Trust us, we will protect (and control)
you... if we don't find it inconvenient..."

Clinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and
accountability, as well.  He had plenty of time to change the policy.

HE DIDN'T.  HE EXPANDED ON IT.

I bet had Bush been in office, you would be in there howling louder
than I.
