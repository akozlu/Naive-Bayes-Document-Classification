as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to
Solaris, i'll heartily agree with this. 

ObCrypt: one of my main gripes with Solaris is its braindead mailx,
which is -almost- enough like mail to get you hoping, but crashes
horribly when you try to do anything useful with it. (like use pgp-
capable sendmail replacements.)
