I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff :).

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it :).


Great!  Where can I buy it?

Another note: If "Clipper" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at 
the moment.


I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it 
from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.
 

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.


Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone 
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute 
for the "voice scramblers" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.


I disagree.  Modulo ITAR, it's not the government that has sabotaged the 
market.


Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right?
