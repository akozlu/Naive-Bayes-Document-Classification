The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks
had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscripts/scrolls
and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated 
(perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions, or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
in power groups, he/I dunno).



Well, perhaps this is the answer then.

Thanks for the tips.  Now I just have to find someone to teach me Samaritan :)

Just me,

little 'e'

(so, is a "good Samaritan hard to find?" or "is a hard... " Oh, finish this
yourself.)
