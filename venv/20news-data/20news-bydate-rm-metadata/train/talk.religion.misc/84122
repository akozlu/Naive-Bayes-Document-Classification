Women who are known not to want abortion services, for example,
might be judged to be more likely to require prenatal care &
coverage for childbirth... which can be an order of magnitude
more expensive than abortion. 

This topic should really be restricted to talk.abortion, which
exists to relieve t.r.m & t.p.m of abortion flamage.
