[constitution sacrificed to the bandwidth gods]

im glad i finally have heard exactly what the OTO is all about.  i finally
know that i can stop looking, content i the knowlege that im not interested.
it's tough enough listening to all the religions who refer to themselves as
"the One Truth".  How can i possibly accept it from a magical order?  "We have
all the Answers and will give them to those who join us (and pay dues)?"
Scary.  Besides, answers are easy.  Questions!  now that's another story...
