Oh, yeah?  Well---*I* know of ....

Anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong
(and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is
PROOF positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  Cannibalism
is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one
alive.  Many other cultures (including many American Indian cultures) eat/ate
the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of
the departed.  Hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.

Have you ever read or seen "Alive", which is the story of the Argentinian boys
soccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died
in order to survive?  Finger lickin good.  How about the Twighlight Zone
episode "To Serve Man"?

If you want more info on this, a good place to start is on sci.anthropology

Now send me $20 and eat my flesh,
