Kent: With all due respect, how can I take you seriously, when you have
the NAMES wrong in the 1st place? E.g.:


	There is no such thing. The correct name is Ancient & Mystical
Order Rosae Crucis, abbreviated AMORC.


	There is no such thing either. It's the Rosicrucian Fellowship.
And they clearly state that they DO NOT pretend to descend from the
Order of the Fama Fraternitatis.


The Lectorium? And who else?


These are NOT Rosicrucian "orders". They are Masonic study groups, none
of which *claims* to be descendant of the original Order.

What is ORC? If you mean AMORC, you didn't even learn the correct
name?!
