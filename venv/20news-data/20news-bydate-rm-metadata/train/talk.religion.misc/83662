I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon.  It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people.


You've made me curious.  What does this say about me?


Charles Manson used revelation as well.  Do we see a pattern here?
I wonder of Koresh liked the Beatles?

Koresh was a nut, okay?  Just because he found ways for the Bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook.


I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand.  He either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so.  Don't make him out to
be a martyr.  He did not "get killed", he killed himself.


The evil was inside the compound.  All that "thou shalt not kill" stuff.
