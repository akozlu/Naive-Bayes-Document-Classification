On a similar note, has anyone found out a way to do this with MS FoxPro for
Windows? My setup.ini file was modified on disk 1 (all encrypted).. Well,
of course I forgot about Microsoft's stupid arrangement when I got the 
software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company I'm doing 
consulting for. When my job is done, it's their software).. Any ideas before
I start doing dumb things to a copy of that file??

ps NO - I don't want to pirate this software. I just want to avoid having
to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then
having a copy lying around I don't use...

maybe I can get a new disk 1...
