There are a couple.  I am personally using screenpeace, which is a
screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
directory (not necessarily the windows dir.).  Let me know if you want
info.  I've been pretty happy with screenpeace, and the latest version
(3) is *not* at cica, but  oak, /windows3/scrpc3or.something
