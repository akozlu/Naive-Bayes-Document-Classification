I have a 486DX-33 computer with a SoundBlaster 1.0 card.  I'm running
Microsoft Windows v3.1.  I have the SB driver set up properly to play
normal sounds (.WAV files, etc.).  I want to play midi files through the
Media Player that is included with windows.  I know I have to set up the
patch maps or something in the MIDI-Mapper in the Control Panel.  I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT MIDI.  (This is to be the way I'll get my feet wet.)

How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files?
