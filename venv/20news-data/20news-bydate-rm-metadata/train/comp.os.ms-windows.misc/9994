DOS 5.0/6.0 cannot read the NTFS file system, although the NTFS file system
can read the FAT file system of DOS.  I have WindowsNT on a seperate
partition on my machine at home, and I can read my DOS disks from Windows NT,
but not vice-versa.

As far as the robustness of the file system, it seems to be very fast, and
I have yet to have a single problem with it.  That doesn't prove it's better
than the FAT system though.  Read the book 'Inside Windows NT,' it will give
you all the info you're looking for.
