Are you using Fastopen?  If you are, disable it.  We had a lot
of problems with fastopen corrupting weird things (including
the Windows permanent swap file) when we were using it.


Indeed they are.  Advanced Personal Measure tells me they are accessed
just before shell.dll


I really like Spinrite and QA Plus
