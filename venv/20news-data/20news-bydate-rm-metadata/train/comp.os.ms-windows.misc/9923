Somewhere (ftp.cica.indiana.edu or SIMTEL20 mirror) there is a program  
called winlogo.zip that does the trick. It works great. I believe the  
reason why you can't change the files you mentioned is that the logo is  
actually imbeded into the windows executable (Somebody please  
correct/expand on this)
