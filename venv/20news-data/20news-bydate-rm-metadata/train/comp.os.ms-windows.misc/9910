It is correct that VC++ is NOT considered an upgrade for C7. C7 is
basically a DOS product, VC++ is a Windows product. As Windows is not
an upgrade for DOS, it is a separate operating system product line, its
utilities cannot be upgrades for DOS utilities. However, I have also
been told that it is NOT an upgrade for QCWIN, which it should be!
