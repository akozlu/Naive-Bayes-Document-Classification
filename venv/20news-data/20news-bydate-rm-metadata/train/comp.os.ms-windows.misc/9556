The 5426 has its own set of drivers. You may be using the
drivers intended for the 5420 or 5422 by mistake.

Be sure you have the 5426 driver version 1.2


Don't quote me on this one, but I'd steer clear of the
multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution
without exiting Windows.  I think it's buggy.


Version 1.3 drivers are due to be release by Cirrus soon.
Unfortunately, their not available via FTP, you have to dial
up their BBS in the USA.  I do this from NZ using a 14.4k modem
to cut down on phone bills.  It took me around 7 minutes to 
download the v1.2 driver.


Good Luck,
