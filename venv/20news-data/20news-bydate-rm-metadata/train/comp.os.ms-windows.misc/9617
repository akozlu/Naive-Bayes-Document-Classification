Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have
to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how
things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are
taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups. 

Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and
run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI. (Yeah, I know
about X-Windows, just haven't been too impressed by it...)..
