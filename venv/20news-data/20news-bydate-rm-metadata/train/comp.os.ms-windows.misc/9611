I've been using MS Access (still available from some stores for $99.00)
and I am quite pleased with it.  It's relatively easy to learn, very easy
to use and somewhat easy to program.  I highly recomend it, particularly
at $99.00!  I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to
be $30.00 better than Access (IMHO).
