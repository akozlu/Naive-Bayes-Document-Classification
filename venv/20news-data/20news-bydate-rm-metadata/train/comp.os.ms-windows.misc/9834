(1) Is it possible to change the icons in the program groups?  I'd like
    to give them some individuality.

(2) Can you set up a short-cut key to return to the Program Manager? 
    I know <CTL><ESC>, <ESC> will do it, but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the P/M with <ALT><F1>.

Any and all help is welcomed.
