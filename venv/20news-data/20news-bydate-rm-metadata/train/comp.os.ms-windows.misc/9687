I just got Mathcad 4.0, and the manual is not clear on the matter.  On page 8:

	:
	:

* At least 4 megabytes of memory.  All memory about 640K should be configured
  as XMS.

	:
	:
* At least 8 megabytes of virtual memory....

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it (4+8=12 < 16) but the
new Mathcad is kinda kooky, and thus is not subject to the laws of common
sense...
