To maintain my senses at their sharpest, I never eat a full meal
within 24 hrs of a ride.   I've tried Slim Fast Lite before a 
ride but found that my lap times around the Parliament Buildings suffered 
0.1 secs.   The resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer
just sharpens my bike's handling and I can always look
forward to a winter of carbo-loading.
