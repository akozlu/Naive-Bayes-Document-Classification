I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.

The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button.
