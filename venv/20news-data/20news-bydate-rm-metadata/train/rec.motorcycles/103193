Again, from my alcohol server's class:
The absolute *most* that eating before drinking can do is slow the absorption
down by 15 minutes.  That gives me time to eat, slam one beer, and ride like
hell to try to make it home in the 10 minutes left after paying, donning 
helmet & gloves, starting bike...
