That sounds like an awfully closed minded, intolerant attitude.

1/2  :')     

I'm not a redneck but . . . try a walk in their shoes first.  Stereotypes
are usually of very limited value.  I've seen as many ignorant
self-righteous "open minded" new age lovers of the great planet Earth
as I have ignorant "red necks".  I don't see a correlation. I don't
believe that the "redneck" culture, if you can call it that, is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other.  

I gotta have a beer, I'm making too much sense.  Next thing you know,
I'll be preaching tolerance . . .. and I'm a conservative.
