It's exactly as dangerous as it looks. You're hard to see and have little
protection. Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits, keeping your
machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid
move that drivers make out there. We deal with it because it's fun, but
staying alive takes a conscious effort.
