I took an alcohol server's class a few years ago.  (What the hey- my employer
paid for it...)

We were told that the 1 drink / hour rule was written with 80 proof booze
and a 195 pound person in mind.  Drinking Cuervo Gold, weighing in @ 140,
I obviously will get drunk faster than the theoretical person mentioned
above.  Worse, imagine Rum & coke made with Bacardi 151...

Mind you all, that's for getting too drunk to drive a car.  I may only
have been riding for a month or so, but I plan my evenings with a very
rigid exclusive or statement: Either don't drink, or don't ride.
Pretty simple.


Sorry, mike, I have to believe that that policy works best as fertilizer,
even if all you plan to do is drive home nice and "safe" in your cage...
