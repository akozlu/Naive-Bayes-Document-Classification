Damn right. I was late for a climbing meet one morning, so I got
out of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep.
It reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of Metatarsals.
Lucky the brake's on the right, but i got funny looks riding thru 
London with one leg held aloft.
