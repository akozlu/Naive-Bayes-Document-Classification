This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to
a "psychological norm" that may not actually apply to a particular dog.
I've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a Charlie Manson
dog or one that's really, *really* stupid.  A large Irish Setter taught me
this in *my* yard (apparently HIS territory) one day.  I'm sure he was playing 
a game with me.  The game was probably "Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor" Before 
He Can Dispense the TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.
