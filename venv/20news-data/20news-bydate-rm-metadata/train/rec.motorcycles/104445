No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change
on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far
enough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same
position, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide
I have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 mile
staying ~200
feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. This
guy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire &
his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh
throttle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes around
me and cuts me off big time. I follow him for about 10 miles and finally
get bored and turn back into work. 

I can file a complaint about this? And actually have the chance to have
something done? How? Who? Where?
