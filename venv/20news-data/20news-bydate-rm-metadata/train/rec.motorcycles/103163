Oh, lord.  This is where I came in.

Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe
I need psychological help.

Obcountersteer v2.0:Anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a-
night MSF class, they don't mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding?
