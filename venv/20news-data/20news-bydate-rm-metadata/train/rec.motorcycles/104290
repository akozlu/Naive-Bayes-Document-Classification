	I had a friend in Pittsburgh who had a CB1000C with the dual-range
tranny on it.  He usually only used the "economy" range to get an overdrive
sixth gear out of it.  He had 59000 miles on it when it was stolen.  It was
recovered shortly after that, repaired, and, for all I know, it's still going
strong.

	The CB1000C was a shaft-driven overbore version of the CB900 and was
made for exactly one year (yep, head and base gaskets are VERY expensive).
Helluva bike.

A data point,
