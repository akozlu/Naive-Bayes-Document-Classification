Hey, what do we look like, a parts store?  Has it ever occurred to you to
visit your dealer and fork out the bucks for a new one?  What are the
chances of someone happening to have a '92 part laying around, much less
one in working condition?  Sheesh, some edu's.  

Besides, I only have the right side inverted GSX-R fork.  It's already been
converted into a floor lamp.
