	imho, you did the wrong thing.  You could have been shot
 or he could have run over your bike or just beat the shit
 out of you.  Consider that the person is foolish enough
 to drive like a fool and may very well _act_ like one, too.

 Just get the heck away from the idiot.

 IF the driver does something clearly illegal, you _can_
 file a citizens arrest and drag that person into court.
 It's a hassle for you but a major hassle for the perp.
