1) The next time you get stoped by a cop, never never never admit to anything.

2) Don't volunteer any information.

3) When a retoracle question is ask by the cop, like "...it <looked> like you were going kinda fast coming down highway 12.  You <must have> been going at least 70 or 75?" -- the correct reponse is to deny it. This technique is employed by police to help establish guilt, especially when (9 times out of 10) he/she is not sure who was doing the speeding. If the cop is unsure this may be the difference of him letting you off the hook or getting the tissue.

Hope this helps for next time.
