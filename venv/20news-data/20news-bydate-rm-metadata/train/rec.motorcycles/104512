& Can somebody tell me what all the letter spesifications on motorcycle models 
& really mean.

Honda:  a "V" designates a V engine street bike. "VF" for V-4, "VT" for V-twin.
"CB" is a street bike with an parallel twin or inline 4-cylinder engine.
"R" used to mean race bike, but is now also used to mean sport bike.
"CL" was for the old steet scramblers-street bikes with high pipes
"CM" was a "custom" street bike
"CR" is dirt only two strokes
"XL" is dual purpose bike
"XR" was dirt only four stroke, but now can be a dual purpose bike if it has
an "L" as a suffix.
