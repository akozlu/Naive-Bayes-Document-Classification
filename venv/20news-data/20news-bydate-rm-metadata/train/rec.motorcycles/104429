  Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite
physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  If
your tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more
likely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium
or small helmet.

  This works for me, and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,
who, at 6'9", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0", and can't
usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...

  Of course, if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you give
helpful motorcycle rides to, then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any
eventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in the
tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
(rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.
