 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
to this approach. It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leather
boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your
attacking foot) and go for the gusto, If that dog doesn't retreat from the
street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really
haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers.


Sorry I can't go this far, A dog against and armored cage just doesn't
seem like a fair fight.


after all it is a dog eat dog world
