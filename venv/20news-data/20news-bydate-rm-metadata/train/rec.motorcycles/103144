No need to appologise, as a matter of fact
this reminds me to bring up something I
have found consistant with dogs-

Most of the time, they do NOT like having
me and my bike anywhere near them, and will
chase as if to bite and kill. 

An instructor once said it was because the 
sound from a bike was painfull to their 
ears. As silly as this seams, no other options
have arrizen.
