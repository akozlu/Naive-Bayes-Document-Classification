I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okay...From 6 feet
or higher, maybe not.


I'd wear the full facer, but then, I'd be *way* more worried
about wind blast in the face, and inability to hear police
sirens, than the helmet being a little damaged.



Well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV
sukhoi. That's just because I like the looks. My current one is
a Shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and I crashed in
it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip
took care of that.). If price was a consideration I'd get
a Kiwi k21, I hear they are both good and cheap.


Be *mildly* mildly paranoid about the helmet, but don't get
carried away. There are people on the net (like those 2% you
mentioned) that do not consistently live on our planet...
