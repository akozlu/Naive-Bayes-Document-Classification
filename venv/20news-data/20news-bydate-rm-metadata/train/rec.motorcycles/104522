--Check the bottom of your pipes Barry -- suspect that is what may
--have hit.  I did the same a few years past & thought it was the
--peg but found the bottom of my pipe has made contact & showed a
--good sized dent & scratch.

-- Believe you'd feel the suddent change on your foot if the peg

Yep, the same thing happened to me on my old Honda 200 Twinstar.
