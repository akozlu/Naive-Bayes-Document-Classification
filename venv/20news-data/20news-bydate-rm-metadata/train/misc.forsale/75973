I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this.
It does have tons of qool stuff in it. 
My impression is that they try not to send it out to "browsers". It
appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you. When you get a catalog there's a "VIP Code" you
have to give them "to ensure your continued subscription.".
Anyway, if you want to get in touch with them, the company is
