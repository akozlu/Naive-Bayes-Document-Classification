A little delayed, but in the interests of fairness (stats from Elias);
        BA    OBP   SLG  R  HR RBI RNI  %   outs
Alomar .310  .405  .427 105  8  76 264 20.5 419
Baerga .312  .354  .455  92 20 105 316 21.2 480

So we see that Baerga has a large advantage in RBI (runs batted in), RNI  
(runners not driven in) and outs.
