Gee, I never knew Valentine made a comment about how Viola signing
with Boston was gonna bring a World Series title to Boston.  I don't
think Valentine ever said Boston will win this year.  Boy, talk about
sensitive, insecure Toronto fans.  :)

In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?
Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does
Toronto have?
