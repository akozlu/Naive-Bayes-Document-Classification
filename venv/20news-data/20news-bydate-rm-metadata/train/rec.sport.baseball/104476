About as good as Mussina's. better than Sutcliffe's and McDonald's

He's in the bullpen. Steinbrenner is in charge after all.


He's got the talent to be the 4th starter now, and evetually the ace.
He was a higher ranked (and generally better) prospect than Arthur
Rhodes who happens to be, well hey, the Oriole's 4th starter.


As for Militello, it's still early.
