I meant to comment on this at the time.

There's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was,
runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.  

Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and
there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent.
