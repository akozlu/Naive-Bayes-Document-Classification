boxscores.

Beware.  The original poster looks to be from Louisville, and chances are  
Louisville gets the edition of the NYTimes that is printed in Chicago for the  
MidWest.  This edition has boxscores only on Monday (and Sunday) and an  
extremely skimpy sports section (few game summaries, mostly just color  
stories).
