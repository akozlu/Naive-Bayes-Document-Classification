Let's try WEEKS! It is April 18th today and I just finished reading posts
regarding the Cleveland Indians boating tragedy. Needless to say, I don't want
to read partial linescores of games played 3 weeks ago.

As Charles mentioned (I excluded the quote): Join a mailing list if you want to
woof (I consider entering 4th inning scores as woofing). Thank you. Now to
plug on and read the rest of the posts about spring training...
