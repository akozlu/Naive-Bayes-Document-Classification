	Strictly from memory, I think the Phillies were something like
	ten games up with 12 to go, lost 10 in a row, and 11 of last 12
	to lose to the Cardinals. Seems impossible, but thats how I
	remember it. I also felt at the time that Johnny Callison of
	the Phillies lost the MVP as a by-product of their swoon.
