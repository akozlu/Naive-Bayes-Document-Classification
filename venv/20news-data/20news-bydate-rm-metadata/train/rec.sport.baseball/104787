  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having
  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically.  
  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team. 
  Orin.
