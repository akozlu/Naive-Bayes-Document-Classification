I've yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambell's soup
and M-16's/AR-15's and banging/marrying thirteen yuear olds. You're a sorry
son of a bitch if you can't draw a distinction between these two things.
People like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
who aren't deserved of it. Get a life and chill on the paranoia.
