I agree, I saw no reason they could not have had "close in" pool
cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever.

[Points made by Dick DeGueran, Koresh's lawyer]

Okay, their word against the FBI's at this point.  See ya in court!


Dear, dear. They could have COME OUT.


Okay, they were living in a fire hazard. That they built.


No crime, irrelevant either way.


Ah yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap.
Always a wise course of action when you're being gassed.


I don't believe there was a "suicide pact".  I believe that Koresh
wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.
In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories.


Yes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where
did they expect to go?


The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost
as bad as running into a fire.


Hm, an interesting notion.  We'll see.


More Bible study, no doubt.  Hey, it's a *priority*.


Actually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and
he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims.  We'll know
more later.  In any event, it's irrelevant.


For six hours they were trapped?  The building was not "destroyed" 
immediately.  They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME.


Six hours to move it away.  Or COME OUT.


Irrelevant, anyway.  PR one way or the other, but no crime or innocence
indicated.


No word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative
question here.


Right.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at 
any point, and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING.  Near BALES OF HAY.


It's ultimately irrelevant who "lit" the fire.  They had ample opportunity
to LEAVE.


Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend
to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators.  (Ex.: Ted Bundy.)


Medical assistance was jsut a phone call away.  Gee, all he had to do
was COME OUT.


Not relevant to any crimes.


While he was there.  Anyway, outsiders RARELY see abuse.  It's a secretive
thing.  All we have to go on are the court documents in the Jewell case
and the mistrial in California.


EXACTLY.  By their OWN CHOICE.


Looks like there will be several investigations, starting with Congressional
committee hearings next week....


I have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS.

If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would
have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not
IRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to
shoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside.

Just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
weapon at him, I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this case.
