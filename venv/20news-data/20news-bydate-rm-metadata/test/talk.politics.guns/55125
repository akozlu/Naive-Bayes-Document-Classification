	Excellent point, Mark.  We should all remember that if Nixon
	hadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his
	subordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal would
	never have brought down his presidency.  So far, Klinton seems
	to be stonewalling this the same way Tricky Dick did.  His whole
	case seems to be "we didn't do anything wrong".  However, if
	in the course of the investigation it turns out that the
	gov't DID do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up,
	then that's an impeachable crime, I believe...  

	Perhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal...  Can you 
	say "Wacogate", little neighbor?...   ;-)
