STOP IT!!!! ENOUGH!!! I'm out of there!  I mean, I'm a relatively sane person. 
God knows I'm weak and will forgive me.  But I'm not stupid enough to stay in
this place any longer.  I WANT OUT!!!


Yeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me.
Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs,
is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to
disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups
who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that
this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never
know...
