I need quotes from Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, or any of the other founders,
that support the idea that the Second Amendment was written into the
Constitution so that the populace could protect itself it the government
began to degenerate into tyrrany. If you have any (with sources), please
mail them to me. Thanks.
