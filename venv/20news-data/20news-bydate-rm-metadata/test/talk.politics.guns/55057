      "I have no question that our plan was correct?"  Months to
get ready, unlimited funds, knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire,
and no fire trucks on hand?   This is "extreme professionalism and care?"

      I can understand the first screwed-up raid by the BATF.  They
underestimated the opposition, which happens.  But not this one.  
The FBI had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time 
for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.  
They still botched it.

      The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign,
or be fired for incompetence.

      I don't blame Reno or Clinton.  They gave the FBI clear orders:
don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that,
wait it out.  Those were reasonable orders.  The FBI said they could
pull off a tactical solution, and they couldn't.
