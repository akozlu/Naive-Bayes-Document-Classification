From article <strnlghtC5tr6D.n3n@netcom.com>, by strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight):


"Well Regulated", at the time of its writing and in the context of the Second Amendment,
means "Properly trained and equipped."

It modern language it would read:

	A properly trained and equipped militia, being necessary to the security of
	a free state <note the word "free", it doesn't say "police"), the right of
	the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
