     point here.  Typically, I might add.

     If it were me, I doubt that *I* would have come out.

     BATF show up, start shooting at me, etc.  Then they paint me
     a child-molesting murdering fanatic, call up TANKS, hundreds
     of automatic-armed goons.  Restrict press access to two miles
     away.
