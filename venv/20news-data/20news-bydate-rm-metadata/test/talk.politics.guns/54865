And done in SECRET ... :-)

Did anybody notice it is the TREASURY DEPT (The FBI and BATF, in other words)
that Clinton wants to do the investigation?  In other words, investigating
themselves?

He sure didn't seem very enthusiastic about Congress doing the investigation,
I notice:  "... well, they can do what they want..."  (Probably insert
a pout here...)

Does anybody smell the attempt for a WHITEWASH?  Betcha the Justice
Dept investigation will, AT MOST say "Possible Poor Judjement.  Too bad..."

Grrr.
