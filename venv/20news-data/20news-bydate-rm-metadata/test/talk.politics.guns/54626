I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not
ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise.

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally,
in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded "national exposure,"
but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.

The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.
We'll never know if he would have kept that one.


Strangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to
"wait as long as it takes."


Quite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing 
line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and 
negligent manslaughter.


This would be an interesting development.


It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to "go state's
evidence," parrot the FBI story, hang the whole "suicide" on Koresh, 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this
in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them
do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is
dead wrong.
