Then post what the press has said, not what you wished they said.
The Medical Examiner has refuted the FBI "facts" and if you don't
believe someone who has a LOT more reason to be impartial then 
what do you have to say for yourself.


I was willing to grant this for sake or argument until I read the
following.

The FACTS as reported by the press and impartial government
sources support ME.


There is NO testimony, at the press conference, the FBI said they
had NO testimony, the SURVIVORS as reported by CNN and Newsday
wire service said that ALL the survivors gave consistent stories
refuting the FBI. They were lighting and heating with kerosine.
Are you trying to PROVE you're an idiot.




Then open your eyes and ears, at least 3 of those 4 sources have
reported your full of shit.
