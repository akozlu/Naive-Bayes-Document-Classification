As quoted from <nate.1504.735838830@psygate.psych.indiana.edu> by nate@psygate.psych.indiana.edu (Nathan Engle):

What laws did they circumvent?  Being "frightening" isn't a crime.  Some people
are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a
young Black male a crime.

The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no
evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement 
personnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be
acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified
armed intruders.

The charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction
in such matters anyway.  Of course that hasn't stopped them from making other
such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical "meth labs".  Of
course they whole "cult" thing indicates the level of contempt that they have
for the 1st amendment.

That armed resistance, at least initially, may well have been LEGAL.
