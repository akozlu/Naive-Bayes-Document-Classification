CNN reported tonight that some bodies were found with bullet holes in their
heads.  However, I have no information on the possible causes.

This is not to say that Government stories are to be taken at the face value in
this case, but to jump to conclusion at this stage may be the source of
embarrassment in the future.  Let's be paranoic, this may be a ploy to smoke
out the opposition and decredit them.  :-)

Comparison of this incidence to Tienanmen Square is made in soc.culture.china. 
Just in case you need more ammunition to shoot at each other.  :-)

No matter which side you are on this Waco issue, are you ready to die defending
your cause?

Peace be with you.
