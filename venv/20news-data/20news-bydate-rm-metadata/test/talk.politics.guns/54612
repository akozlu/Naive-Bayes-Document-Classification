	If there was a large propane tank, and it was breached, don't 
	you think that there would be an identifiable explosion?
	Further, the BD members have as much reason to lie as the 
	Gov't.



	They'd only autopsied one body when this information was released.
	I wouldn't doubt though



	The only evidence that exists right now (at least what we know
	about) is various claims and counter claims. I'm waiting until
	the hard evidence is released. What about you?
