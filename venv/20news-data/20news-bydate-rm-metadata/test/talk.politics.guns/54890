Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves,
but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about
three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards 
you can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 
hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.

So it ain't exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them 
pancakes, Aunt J..."  If you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for
heating your house at night, you will have it lit to SOME extent all 
the time.  Trust me on this one, I speak from experience.
