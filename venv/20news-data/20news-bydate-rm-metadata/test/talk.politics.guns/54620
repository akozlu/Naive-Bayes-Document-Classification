So out of the numerous baptists that you hang around with you haven't
seen any of the above behavior? Which trait (stocking food for more
than a week, or owning a firearm) is the definition of a cult? What

"banging/marrying" of thirteen year olds was going on? Does your
wife know that you equate 'marriage' with 'banging'?

going to insult you AND your mom!
