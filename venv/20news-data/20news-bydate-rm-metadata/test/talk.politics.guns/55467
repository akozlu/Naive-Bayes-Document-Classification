(Whatever the above comment has to do with the hazards of fighting a
fire in the midst of ammo cooking off...)
Maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about
being diverted from their other duties, and the FBI said "FIne. Go home
and we'll call you if we need you."  A million things could have happened,
we don't know.

BTW, this is the first time I have heard that the Waco FD was on scene
for all but the last 2 days...  what's the source (out of curiosity)?
