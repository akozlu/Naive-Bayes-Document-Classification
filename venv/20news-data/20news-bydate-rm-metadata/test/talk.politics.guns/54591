In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians
would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the
fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and
therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining
Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this
theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there,
and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She
actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).

While I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway), 
it is incidental to their reaction.
