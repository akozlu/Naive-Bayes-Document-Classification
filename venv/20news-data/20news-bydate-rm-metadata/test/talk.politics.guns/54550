  Yes, I think so and it has been reported as such.  Seems like a cowboy
movie-style attack was needed for some reason....


  The answer is probably YES. But consider; what was the WORST thing that
could have happened if they waited?  Hint: whatever it was it could not have
been any worse that what DID happen.  


  But that statement of taking full responsibility is totally meaningless.
What are the consequences for being fully responsible for this disaster?
A note in your personnell file??  Slick already called these people a bunch
of crazy people and dismissed the idea she should resign.  Doesn't take 
ANY balls at all to take the responsibility.  Hell, at that rate >I< will
take full responsibility for it.  No skin off my nose....
