Well, I don't normally like to quote myself, but I just got some
additional information.  I called my state rep (to express my support),
and the person there informed me that it's actually just a second
reading of the bill (three are required) for further consideration.
I'm not 100% sure what *that* means, and I'm also not sure why
there's a discrepancy between what the two offices are telling me.

Still researching....
