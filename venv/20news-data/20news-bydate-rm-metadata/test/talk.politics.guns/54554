And you'd be wrong about that too.

Note that Texas isn't unique in this "more with-gun deaths than
with-car deaths", but some of the other states where it happens have
extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the "meaning".

It isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car
accidents are unintentional while gun deaths aren't, but if we're
going to make it, let's at least be honest.


Give it up for what?  Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so
it fails by this standard.


Note that insurance gives me something in return - gun control doesn't.


That's half the question - the rest is "and what do you get for your
sacrifice".  If the answer to the second question is "nothing", as it
is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question
because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.
