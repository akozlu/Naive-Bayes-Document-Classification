Spike is owned by both Tom and I.  We went 1/2's on the purchase price
and have split costs of needed parts, registration, etc.  Both names are
on the pink slip.

I am covered by insurance to ride the Harley.   I'd give it a go if
I could work the clutch.  I can barely get the clutch lever to move
using both hands while standing next to the bike.  Ol' Sport is a
very distinctive bike.
The Concours is favorite of mine.  I've pillioned an easy 4000 miles
on that bike in the last year.  Unfortunately, my feet are a good
10" off the ground once I'm on her.  No way I could take her for a
ride as pilot rather than pillion.  If I could fit on a Concours, I'd
buy one.  IMHO, the best sport-tourer made.  I'm not _too_ upset
I had to settle for the Ducati 750SS as my touring bike, though. :-)

So, now you know.
