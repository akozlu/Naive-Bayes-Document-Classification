	Yep! I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision... I should mention  
that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) . The wheelie was  
the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an  
intersection (damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers).  

	However, I have done one by myself, it just takes a lot of  
pre-clutch dump rev action.
