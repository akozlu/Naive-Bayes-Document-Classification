Sigh.   That's music to my ears, after all the complaining Lois did
about the seat on my BMW...


I've found that the phrase "sack of potatoes" works pretty well in
describing to a passenger how s/he should act.


On a long ride with my ex-girlfriend Nancy, I would notice her
drifting off every so often (we were droning down highway 101 to LA).
I probably wouldn't have been aware of this if she hadn't been in the
habit of squeezing my butt with her knees to hold on.   Good advice.
