McGuyers makes a full line of polishing compounds and waxes... Read
the lables and pick the one that matches the marks that you see on the
paint. Then do both you and your fiance a favor by putting a nice
thick coat of the carnuba wax on the bike. After that those little
scratches will just buff out.
