+Has anyone, while driving a cage, ever waved at bikers? I get the urge,
+but I've never actually done it.

I've had people in cages wave at me or give me the thumbs up on
occassion.  (I always return the wave or thumbs up).  That never
happened to me until I started riding Harleys, so that may have
something to do with it.

Why not try waving?  What bad could happen?
