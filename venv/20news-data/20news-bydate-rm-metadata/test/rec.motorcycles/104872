In Shreveport, back when I was riding the Purple Water Buffalo, I jumped an 
intersection IN FRONT OF A COP who was waiting for the light!  The side of 
the street he was on was hidden buy a building on the corner and I didn't 
see him till I was airborne in the middle of the intersection.  I was 
parked, had my helment off and my liscence out before he turned the corner.  
He chewed my ass out and let me go!  I will be the first to admit it was a 
very squidly thing to do, jumping the intersection like that.  The cop 
should have nailed me.  I find that if you are polite, respectfull and 
honest, they will normaly let you get away with a LOT of stuff.

P.S. The shock mounts folded up the next day.  I guess I deserved that!
