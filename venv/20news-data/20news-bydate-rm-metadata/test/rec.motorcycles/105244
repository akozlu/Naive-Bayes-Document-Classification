: My 83 Nighthawk has two (related?) problems with the ignition system:
: 
:   - it won't start when on cold mornings ( 10 C, 50 F or so)
:   - I always need to give it gas when starting it, even when using
:     the clutch.
: 
:   This all still happens after a tune-up and a new battery, 
:   any ideas on what could be wrong with the bike?

I think you have the choke (starter) jet blocked and even the idle one.
