Does anybody share my opinion that in big-city traffic a bike can be so
low-powered that for example it cant accelerate out of trouble when
necessary..the "screwed-down" versions of bikes sold on the German
market with the different classes of liscence seems to make a lot of
middle aged men putt putt around on 25-40Km/Hr maschines that are
constantle getting in the way of "real" traffic!

Does anybody else have opinions on this topic!?
