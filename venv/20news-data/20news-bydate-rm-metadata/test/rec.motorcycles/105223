I have been checking out bikes (hoping for lowish seats) for a few weeks.  A
Honda Twinstar (250cc) fit me well, a Honda Hawk (400cc) did not, the
Kawasaki 250HB/SB/SH? (can't remember) looked like it would fit me well but
the price tag was way too large...


Please post this list or mail me one too!
