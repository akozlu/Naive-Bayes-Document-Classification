Black ones look better.  None are truely indiginous to America,
although some of the finest are produced here.  Gear is expensive, and
you never seem have enough of it.  Volvos hit them.  Only idiots
intentionally rear up the front half off the ground just to look cool.
Posers don't ride them in the rain.  They are dangerous on ice.  Loud
ones are annoying, and too much chrome looks dumb.

Yep, sounds familiar!
