I read that GM wants to keep the Design part of Lotus but lose the car
production. And, I seem to remember, that the main problem with the Elan
was caused by GM's insistence that the Elan be re-designed (significantly)
for the US market which caused major design & production headaches. 


Quite true - brain fade on my part.
