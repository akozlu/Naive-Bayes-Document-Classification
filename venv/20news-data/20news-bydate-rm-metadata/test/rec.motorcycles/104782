Oh, Bill, you are so full of shit.  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.




ObMOTO:  I happened to miss the discussion of deltabox frames, if there was
one, because I actually needed to get some work done last week.  So if anybody
would care to repeat what got said (since I was the guy who asked, and I'm
still ignorant) could you email me?  Thanks.
