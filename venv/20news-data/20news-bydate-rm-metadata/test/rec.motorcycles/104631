Hey, I don't really care, but when someone sends me
email telling me to fuck off, I get rather pissed.  If he posted
to the net, I could really care less, but sending mail
is just childish.  Mr. Infant(e) is just that, an infant.  Give 
him a few more years to grow up and maybe he'll learn some 
network etiquette.

If you can't stand the flames,
and you don't have the brains,
Stay out of the newsgroup.

Kind of catchy n'est pas?
