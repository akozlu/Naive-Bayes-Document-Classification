Might depend on where you live .. I know locally, for most of the winter
the ground, and concrete floor, within sheds and garages (unheated) is
signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature.  The air does get
warmer during the day, but during the night, the ground and concrete
is definitely warmer, especially when protected by the walls from the
albedo effect.  And the nights are longer by several hours than the
days.
