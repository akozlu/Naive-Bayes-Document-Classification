	Greetings. There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes:

	1) A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the
	   tape. The message usually reads, "If seal is broken, you must
	   buy this tape"

	2) The standard "MacroVision" warning, "Copies of this tape will
	   be unviewable"

	3) [your case] Extended message for the Average Consumer (tm) which
	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the
	   original. I don't believe you can sue them for misinformation
	   in cases like this :-)

	Take care.

	P.S. Of course, #3 is utter BS - but the Average Consumer (tm)
	     believes it. Heck, my mom once returned such a tape without
	     watching it... she was afraid that something might just 
	     happen :-)
