Pretty high frequency for one chip...


Yes and no. I would use the FM transmitter chip from Motorola (Linear and  
Interface Databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. SBL-1 from  
mini circuits lab). Everything is done in the FM chip and then mixed up with  
the oscillator frequency. Just have a look at the ARRL Handbook. There are lots  
of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. I don't think, there are single  
chip designs for such high frequencies yet.
