Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
refresh rates common.

So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.
