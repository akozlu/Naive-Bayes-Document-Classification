Jeez, that should do it.


Very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate
distances ... might be more interesting than my application.  Just a thought,
you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote
control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse.  A Hamamatsu
detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give
the current position.  Store and collate this on a computer and you could
replay the movements on the screen.  Interesting!
