I think all connections in Norway can handle touchtone dialing.

The Oslo-region has one system, the rest of the country another system.

(Almost right for pulsdialing.)
Some phones have a little switch inside, so you are able to use them
all over Norway, or you can just renumber the numbers on your phone.
