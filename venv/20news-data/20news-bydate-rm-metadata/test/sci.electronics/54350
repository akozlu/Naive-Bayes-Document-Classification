You don't say what kind of "electronic equipment" you mean.  It's hard
to give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that won't
do things like washing lubricant out of switches.

When we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just
used distilled water.  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear
is *completely* dry before powering it up again.  We let it dry for
several days to be damn sure.

I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water.  I would
be very wary of CCl4, not least because it is dangerous to *you* even
if it's not going to harm the equipment -- not only is it poisonous,
but I believe it's now known to be carcinogenic.
