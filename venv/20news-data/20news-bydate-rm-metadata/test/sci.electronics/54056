I have a couple applications for high speed data links
1__replacement of ultrasonic signal coaxial cables with fiber optic cable
2__applying fiber optic slip ring for 16 channel ultrasonics inspection
system for CANDU reactor inspection
3__remote data link from ultrasonic pipeline inspection device including
