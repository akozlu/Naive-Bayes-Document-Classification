I know of at least one ftp-site from which you can download the cracks of
about any commercial game in existence. The names of the companies (yes,
companies!) are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes. According to
them, it is not illegal (at least in the USA, according to a statute or 
something) to remove the copy protection from any program. The only condition
is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own
convenience.

If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such 
company. I will not give the name of this ftp-site to anyone, even if only
to protect the companies which wrote the original games.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone the use or cracking of any programs. I believe 
it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run.

On the subject of copy protection: Most pirates don't give a damn about 
using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting 
the program. They just don't have a conscience.
