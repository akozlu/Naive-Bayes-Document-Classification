You're right, it is HAPP Controls, Inc., but you can buy direct from them.  I
don't have a phone number with me, but anyone interested in it can email me for
it.  I don't remember their button price, but the joystick price was $8.95
per dozen at last check.  Should be slightly higher for one or two, but cheaper
than Parts Express.  As for the trackballs, i don't know the new price either.
But I can sell you rebuilt arcade trackballs for $50.  That includes new rollers
and new bearings (when nec.).  I also have a pile of used joysticks and buttons
that i would be willing to sell.  Please email to address below if interested.
