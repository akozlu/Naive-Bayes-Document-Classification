That's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do.
IMHO it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as
possible AND to sell the customers detail manuals (for the brain-deads)
, quick reference books, how to do books and videos, paid support hot line
(1-900 :).  For the registered purchasers, these can be part of their package.
I have seen many books to teach people how to use DOS, WP and other software.  I
I suspect either users can't read the manuals or they don't have manuals.
Either way, there is $$$ to be made.   BTW books are quite a bit more
expensive to reproduce than a $1 disk.


With the popularity of Multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems
(eg. OS0.5, Windoze, Mack System 7), it is pretty easy to run a debugger
and figure out the protection schemes by disassembling/tracing/trapping
the application during run time.  Schemes like compressed software/
special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers.

Hardware keys (unless well designed and *TOTALLY* transparent) is a
pain in the b*t.  We having using a piece of software under Windoze
that uses a hardware key.  The key interfers with the printer stuff
with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software
to work properly.


All the hacker has to do is to remove/modify code that communicate with
the port.
