Oh dear, time for me to try to remember my chemistry.  Let's see if I
can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind.
<sounds of gears>  <fumes of overheated oil>  <unmistakable stench of
the Nasal Chromatograph>   Ha!  I knew there was a double bond!  Now
how shall I show that in ASCII? 

          MEK:                                 Acetone:

          C - C - C - C                        C - C - C
              #                                    #
              O                                    O

The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond.  MEK has a
methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone
has two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead
is dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think
that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.
It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.  Use acetone.

Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.  If you buy
some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more
expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need.
