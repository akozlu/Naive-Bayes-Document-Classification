The 9144w4 is the date code but none of my books list a W03563.
What is it out of and can you tell us what kind of circuit it is in?

In the odd case that 9144w4 is not the date code, NTE says a 9144-60
is an AM reciever subsystem and a 9144-61 is an FM subsystem, but these
are both in 16 pin packages.
