For those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cable
leakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage that
is "causing interference to other services".

Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, and
measurement technique.  If you will clearly document your problem,
and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the
normal approach, remember to correct between measurement data and
microvolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong
Cable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letter
to the local cable company, you will get results.  In fact the cable
company will probably start treating you much better when they realize
you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention.

What is important is to document your case as it relates to the
applicable rules.  However the cable company *is required* to
at least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must file
with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement
report that details the results of leakage testing.

But remember, call the cable company first, and give them a
chance to work to correct the problem before contacting
the commission.

I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via
the airborne method.
