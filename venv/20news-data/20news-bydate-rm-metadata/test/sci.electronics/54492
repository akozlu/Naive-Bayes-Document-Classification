Bzzzzzt! Wrong answer.  The UK tone dialling is identical to the US system. 
The different settings on your modem are so that it uses CCITT V21 & V22 
tones for data transmission, rather than Bell 103 & Bell 121 tones, which are 
used only in the USA and canada AFAIK.  As most people now use at least 
V22bis, this is largely irrelevant.
