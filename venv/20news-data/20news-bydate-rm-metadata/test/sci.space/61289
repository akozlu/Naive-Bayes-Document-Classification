   Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled,
"Habitable Planets for Man" (I think) in 1964.  It should be available
in most good libraries, or through inter-library loan.

   It answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along
with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies:
length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural
concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of
xenon narcosis?  neither did I), density of particulates in the atm, and
their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.

   Climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you,
but axial tilt ought to.  It plays a large part in determining the
severity of seasonal differences, and a lesser but still significant
part in determining the speed of prevailing winds.
