Much of Cook's later exploration was privately funded, by Joseph Banks
among others (eg in Resolution & the earlier Endeavour).  Colnett's voyage
to the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of
British whaling vessels.  Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded
by London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy.  The list is
almost endless.  Those doing the funding were about eighty percent
motivated by potential profit, ten percent by potential glory and ten
percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge.
