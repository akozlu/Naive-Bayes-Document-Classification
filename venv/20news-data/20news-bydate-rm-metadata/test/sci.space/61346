The temperature of intergalactic space (or intercluster or 
intersupercluster space) would be very, very close to the microwave 
background temperature, 2.73 kelvins.  I recall that in interstellar 
space in our neighborhood of the galaxy it's something like 4 K.

Is that what you were looking for?
