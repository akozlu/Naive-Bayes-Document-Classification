a yes,  but the improvement in  boost orbit to the HST is Significant,
and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables
so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the
array tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out
on the HST in the next 9 months.
