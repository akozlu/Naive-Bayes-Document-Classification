located just North of Moscow is correct.  It is the home of several
Russian space enterprises, including NPO Energia, Krunichev, Fakel,
and Tsniimach.  The main Russian manned spacecraft control facility
is also located here.
   Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tours
can be arranged.  Call ahead though, there are still armed military
guards at many of these facilities -- who don't speak English,
aren't well paid, and are rather bored.
   It's a very popular destination with Western space industry
types at the moment.
