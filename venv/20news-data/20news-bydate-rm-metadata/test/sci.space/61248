George William Herbert sez:


I like your optimism, George.  I don't know doots about raising that kind
of dough, but if you need people to split the work and the $700M, you just
give me a ring :-)  Living alone for a year on the moon sounds horrid, but
I'd even try that, if I got a bigger cut.  :-)
