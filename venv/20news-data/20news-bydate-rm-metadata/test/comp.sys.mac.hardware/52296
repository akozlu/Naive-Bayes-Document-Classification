  I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I (the original!).
Have you tried cleaning the print heads? With the SWII driver, it's
and option in the Print dialog box. Sometimes I had to do it several
times to get the crud out. Yes it wastes ink, but it beats those
white annoying lines.
  Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big
black box. It can help to get the ink flowing.
  Good luck!
