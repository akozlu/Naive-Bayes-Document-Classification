   Huh?  Where did you get this idea from?  I think you got this
backwards.  The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5
cycles I believe).  Things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duo
doesn't have undocked).  Extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too.  Real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen
depth you are running etc.
