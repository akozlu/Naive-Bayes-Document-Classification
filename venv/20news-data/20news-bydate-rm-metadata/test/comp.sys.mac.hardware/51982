It already happened as far as I know... I got some email about three
weeks ago saying it was coming, and sure enough, a week after that the
Duos dropped in price.  I think the Duo 210 4/80 is now around
US$1,8xx.

The educational prices have dropped, and I imagine others as well, but
I haven't really checked around since I boycott the local NecroCenter
for reasons that extend over the past 13 years.
