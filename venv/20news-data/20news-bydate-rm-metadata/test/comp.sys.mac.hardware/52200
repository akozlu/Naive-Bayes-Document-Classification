:     What paper is that? It's been on the price list here at Dartmouth
: since they released it and it has never been called the "DuoDock Plus." 

It was a paper from Apple Sweden that announced some new products (the new
docking station was only one of them), and the paper arrived before it showed
up on the price list. I don't know if it's still called the "DuoDock Plus"
in the price list, it could be a mistake by someone at Apple Sweden.
