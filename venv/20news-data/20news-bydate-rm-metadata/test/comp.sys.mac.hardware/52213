Are you sure it's not a problem caused by software?  I've seen this sort 
of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT 
conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video 
hardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the 
Q950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to 
24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - 
it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed 
then.

Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like 
QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some 
of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.
