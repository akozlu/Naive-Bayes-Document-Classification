The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as
the analog sweep board) is on its way out. Apart from a board swap (bikkies to
Apple), there's not much the average Joe can do to fix it.

You can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should
be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a
temporary fix. A copy of Larry Pina's "Macntosh Repair & Upgrade Secrets" is a
worthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.
