My school is settinÿûg up a new network with bothe Macs and Apple II's.  I'm
used to ethernet, and don't know muÿch about LocalTalk.  Two things:  first,
in MacWherehouse, btheÿy have PowerUser network connectors, and the caption
leads you to belÿûieve that you can plug them into the phone lines in the
building and have them work.  Is this true?  I've seen it done by running
sepÿerate phone cords, but never with real lines.  Second, if that does work,
could you use a modem ÿhooked up to that same line while the network was
active?  Help would be greatly appriciated.  BTW-ÿrunning seperate phone line 
is out of the question, the network wil  VERRY spread o.
