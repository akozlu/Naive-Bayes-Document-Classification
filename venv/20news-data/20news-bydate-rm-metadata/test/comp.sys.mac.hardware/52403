I have a few questions that I would like answers to 
(or opinions on) since I'm thinking about buying a LC-III:

Q1) When the PowerPC-based Macs are announced, what will
happen to the 680X0-based Macs?  

Q2) Is System 7 the 'last word' for 680X0-based Macs? 
Will we ever get REAL multi-tasking for the Mac?

Q3) Will there be a way for NuBUS/PDS-equipped Macs to add 
a PowerPC-on-a-board to their systems?

I'd hate to think that I'm going to put my $$ down
on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a
dead-end product line!

Thanks in advance,
