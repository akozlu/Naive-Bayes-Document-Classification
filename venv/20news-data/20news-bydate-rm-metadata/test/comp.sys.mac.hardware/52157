The general consensus seems to be that an extended keyboard (or the new
ergonomic keyboard) with mouse is ok. The PB160 is rated for 200mA which is
apparently identical to the LC and the LC works fine with said attachments.

Thanks very much to those who replied...I am now on my way to order a Battleship
and a mouse....    :)
