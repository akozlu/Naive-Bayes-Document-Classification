Re: Methods for attaching heat sink to processor.

Go to Radio Shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. It comes
in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  At
Radio Shack, it's catalog number 276-1372.  It's a mix of
silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  Plus, it's
tacky.
