	The computer itself uses far less electricity than a TV. 
Monitor--depends on the size :).

	But one thing NOT to do is use a self-shutdown or power-shutdown 
iron/appliance on the same electric line.

	After a new monitor and power supply and modem, my wife *still* doesn't
think her iron is at fault :(.	(She should know better, being a Bio-med
engineer :)
