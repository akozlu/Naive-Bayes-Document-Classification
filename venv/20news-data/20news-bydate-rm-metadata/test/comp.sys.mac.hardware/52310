I am using a NEC 4FG with my Centris 610. The cable adapter was provided by
NEC (you have to call to get this free adapter). I am also sharing it with my
486 (using a switch box and extra cables).

My questions: 

	How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed?
	Or how do you change the mode(resolution)? 
	Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW?

I am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display
1028x768(?) with my 486.
