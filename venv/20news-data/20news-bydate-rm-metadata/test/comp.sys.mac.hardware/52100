I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external
drive.  I did call Apple Catalog as recommended and they told me the drives
were back ordered until May 8.  I placed an order anyways and two days later
I had a visit from Federal Express.  Well, you can guess how I spent my weekend.
Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange
when you order from the Apple Catalog.  You may want to check if they have any
internal drives.
