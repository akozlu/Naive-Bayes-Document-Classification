        Interesting, as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree.  I know of several people I work
with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have
a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  They also
didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local University either. :(
       I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice, than a truly specialty field.  It will be even more
so in the future.
       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field
of Software Engineering.  The difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon
unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides
the missing key for some good groundwork!


Well, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are
in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out
of a Top 10 comp sci school.

The trick is, to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the
rest of your education...TRUST ME its the best way to go..even
if you don't get a TOP salary.  Which I have always been a poor
slob throughout school but if you follow this rule: BOOK=SALARY=FOOD&SHELTER
you should always have a computer and you won't go hungry.

What else could a man want?!
