Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical 
trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal 
candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the 
frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the 
candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus 
should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the 
intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to 
oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the 
lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really 
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.


The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all 
conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if 
conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard 
medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?
The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very 
important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria 
after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason 
to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply 
and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).
