	real good idea?  That 60 channels of television is 10x better 
	than 6 channels of television?  


	You're right.  Keep an open mind to the following:

	1. Taco flavored donuts.
	2. Cannibalism.  Good way to get that extra protein in the diet.
	3. Belief in Yawanga, armadillo god of parking meters.
