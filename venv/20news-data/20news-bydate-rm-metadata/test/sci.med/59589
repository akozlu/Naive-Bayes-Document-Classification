    But no one (or at least, not many people) are trying to pass off God
as a scientific fact.  Not so with Kirlian photography.  I'll admit that

people want to label that intelligence "God", I'm not going to stop
them.  Anyway, let's _not_ turn this into a theological debate.  ;-)


    Read alt.fan.robert.mcelwaine sometime.  I've never been so
closed-minded before subscribing to that group.  :)
