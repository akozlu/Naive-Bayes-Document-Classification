I too have had premature ventricular heartbeat, starting in 1974.  (These 
are not, by the way, "extra" heartbeats.  This is how they feel, and 
this is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they're 
actually *premature* heartbeats.  I would sometimes experience a lapse 
after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time, 
making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.) 

I had them persistently for eighteen years.  Then I went on a low-fat 
diet, and they just stopped.  I haven't had a single episode of PVH 
for almost two years.  I know:  correlation does not imply causation. 
This is just FWIW.
