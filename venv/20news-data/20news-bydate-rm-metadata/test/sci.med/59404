=Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling)
=photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
=narrow-minded, "I know it all", "I don't believe what I can't see or
=measure" attitude of many people out there.

Where have you seen that attitude?

=I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to
=so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just
=as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be
=quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.

=I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
=something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
=of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists,
=were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.

Fine, jackass.  Suppose you point out even ONE aspect of Kirlian photography
that's not explained by a corona discharge.
