Greg:  Flame definitely intended here.  Bill was making fun of the misspelling. 
Go look up the word "krill."  Also, the correct spelling is Kirlian.  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a high-voltage source, not of some "aura."  It works equally well
with inanimate objects.
