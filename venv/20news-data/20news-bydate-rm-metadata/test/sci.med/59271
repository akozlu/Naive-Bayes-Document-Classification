=Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY
=time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.

Which points up the "studies" made by amateurs:  Did you ALSO check EVERY TIME
YOU DID *NOT* get sick?  "No," you say?  Why not check every thing you eat when
you don't get sick and find out how much MSG you're actually consuming?

=> All that's needed now is that final step, a double-blind study done
=> on humans.  There isn't even an ethical question about "possible
=> harm", as this is a widely used and approved food additive.

=But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -
=some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many
=people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I
=KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.

If you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't want
to participate because it involved MSG, you'd've already made yourself
ineligible (since MSG IS detectable by taste). How can anybody be so clueless
as to what double blind studies are all about?
