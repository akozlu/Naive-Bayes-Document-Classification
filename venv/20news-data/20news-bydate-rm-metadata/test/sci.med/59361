:Hello,
:I heard that a certain disease (toxoplasmosys?) is transmitted by cats which
:can harm the unborn fetus. Does anybody know about it? Is it a problem to 
:have a cat in the same apartment?
:

Having the cat around is not a problem, but the pregnant woman should not
change the litter box.  Toxoplasmosis can be transmitted from the stool of
some cats.
