Good idea, But why put all the eggs in one basket?

Given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks, why
not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to
be guarded better than Fort Knox.

Give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping. The USA has over 10,000
banks and thrifts - there are not likely to be more than 2,000,000 Clipper
phones sold.
