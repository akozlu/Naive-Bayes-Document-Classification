find it at the present time.

From the original FAQ:

Question: Does anyone take David Sternlight serious?

Fact: No one takes David Sternlight serious. They review his opinions and
in most cases immediately discard them or jerk them over to
alt.fan.david-sternlight which actually should be alt.flame.david-sternlight.
