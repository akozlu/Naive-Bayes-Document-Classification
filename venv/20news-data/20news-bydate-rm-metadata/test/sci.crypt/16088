In some hobby shop, they sell a flexible tube (1/4-inch diameter,
18-inch ling) that will illuminate if you bend or shake it (it
is also sold in amusement parks in the evenings). The brightness
can last 2 to 4 hours. If it is left in refrigrator (in coldness),
you can prolong its life of illumination.
