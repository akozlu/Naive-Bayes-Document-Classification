I've been reading the sci.crypt, alt.privacy.clipper and comp.org.eff.talk
discussions about the Clipper chip and find (as usual) that most of us
think alike -- so there's a lot of repitition.  If each of these messages
were sent to Clinton as well as to the net (or instead of to the net), we
might actually have some effect.
