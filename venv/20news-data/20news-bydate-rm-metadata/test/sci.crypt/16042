   I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
   pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
   that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
   or refute this?

Yes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff. 

The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of
signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully,
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked
Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.
In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk, etc.

With newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to
isolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels.
But "Everything has vibrations", as Master Chuan said.
