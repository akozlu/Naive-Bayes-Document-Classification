        Looking at it from up here in the Frozen North, it looks like
        you could do worse than get the NRA involved. They have a
        kindred problem, a large number of voters, the right attitude,
        and lots of funds.

        From an ethical _or_ constitutional viewpoint, I haven't seen
        a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesn't also
        support the NRA position on guns (and vice-versa).

        Cheers,
                Marc
