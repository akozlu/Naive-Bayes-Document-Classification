I found the personal attacks on Prof. Denning pretty disgusting.
I don't agree with all her positions; but I think scholars can
disagree without the argument getting into the gutter.

If these personal attacks are what stopped Prof. Denning from
replying on issues of substance, they have cause real harm
to the serious debate here.
