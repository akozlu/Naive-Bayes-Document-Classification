Are you sure that the field is in the area you found the antenna
farm?  The tomb ("Ymvos") of Marathon which Herodotus specifies as near
the fighting area is in an area open to the public.

You must be referring to the U.S. army base of "Nea Makri".  It was
built by the U.S. in the same manner as bases all over the world
(W. Germany, Spain, Philippines, Turkey etc.) were built.  I think
it was a telecommunications hub.  Over the recent years U.S. forces
have withdrawn from the base and removed all military equipment.  The
area is currently under the control of the Greek Navy until the all
interested parties (local goverment, central goverment, political parties
agree on what should be done with the land (park, recreation area,
real-estate.)

(This has nothing to do with cryptography, security and the EFF; I have
redirected followups to soc.culture.greek)
