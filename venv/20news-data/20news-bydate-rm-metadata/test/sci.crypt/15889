	Well, actually, this one's easy. It's their job. The NSA is
supposed to develop cryptosystems. If the government chooses to go
ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses, so be it.

	This sounds a lot like slamming the competition, not a cry
for justice. These guys are way out on a limb, if I read that right.
They've commited their new algorithm to silicon before it's been
made public. What are they gonna do if Shamir writes a paper showing
how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide
rule and a pencil?

	If they weren't busy throwing muck to smear their competitors,
I'd feel kinda sorry for 'em. Still do, a little.
