Hmmmmmm.  $30 seems a bit expensive.  How big is the chip?  What kind
of packages will be used?  3 volt or 5 volt technology?  How much
current will it draw?  I think there are many practical questions
that haven't been answered, especially since this chip already exists!


OK, I've got a big problem with all of this.  How in the world do you
expect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved
in this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at 
a time:  give me a break.  And how long does all of this take?  Even if
it is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to 
turn out 300 of these things.  How long do you suppose it will take to
program those 10,000 chips mentioned above?  This is highly impractical!


So where can I find info on this AT&T device?  What kind of vocoder
does it use?  Does it require ISDN phone lines?  If not, is it full
duplex?  How does it sound?  What kind of synchronization scheme is
used?  Will all other little black boxes have to conform to AT&Ts choices
of protocol, etc.?  Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that
conform to these specifications?
