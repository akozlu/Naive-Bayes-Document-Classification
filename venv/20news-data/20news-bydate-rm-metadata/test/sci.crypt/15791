That is not true, with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined
without the full search.


I am not willing to take that bet.


You can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip......
As for the key, it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to
the chip, so I can pick my keys too.


BING BING BING BING BING, THAT EXACTLY MY POINT, SINCE WE CANT KNOW THAT
THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS CAPABILITY, THE ONLY SAFE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY
DO... i admit that most of my cryptographic complaints are probably
unfounded, but since we cant know one way or the other, im not gonig to
take their word for it....


Oh come on, thats like saying you could evaluate DES without the S-box
constants.....
