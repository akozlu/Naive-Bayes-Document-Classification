Exactly what would that show, ?! the "law enforcement block" is easy to
create, given the Government key and any serial number. 


*IF* it comes to trail about the wiretap.... ya, some safegaurd that is.
What if they just harass people as a result, or learn things they shouldn't
have learned, etc? 


The whole point of the Escrow system is to prevent the FBI from making 
illegal wiretaps. Why not have the FBI holds the
keys and that's it? Why do we need the escrow system at all?

Unless a 3rd party (a judge) verifies that the requested serial number
is "right", and the FBI can get any key they like at anytime, the escrow
system is useless.
