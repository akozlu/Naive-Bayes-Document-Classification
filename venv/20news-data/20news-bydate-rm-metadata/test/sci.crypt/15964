I am both new to this news group and to the net.
        
        I am facinated by the things I have heard about the PGP
encryption program.  Does anybody out there know where I might get a
version of this program that runs under Windows 3.1, MS-Dos, Unix
w/source?  As of this writting I have no UNIX access and am running on a
nifty windows implamentation of uucico.
        Thanks in advance!
