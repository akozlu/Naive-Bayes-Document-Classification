Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that
needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.

The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%
quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an 8bit gif!
