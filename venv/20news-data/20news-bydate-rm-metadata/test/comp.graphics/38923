It is for a business and the end product has to be a photograph.
I take damaged black and whites, usually old, some very, and repair them
by hand at present.  I would like to do this by using a computer.
I am just trying to find a vendor who can convert my computer stored
images to negatives or thermal print.  The customer will want his/her
copy as much as possible like a brand new original photgraph.
