G'Day All,

I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF, TGA or even PPM.

I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also.

I've seen Alchemy (for DOS) and some windows image viewers which can save
an image in other formats, but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer...

Any help would be apprieciated!

cheers
Stephen.
