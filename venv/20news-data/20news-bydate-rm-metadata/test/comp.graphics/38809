Peter> Yep, here's a theory that I once heard bandied around.  Rather than thinking
Peter> of the number think of the sound. For Tea Two. A sort of anagram on Tea For Two,
Peter> Two for Tea, For Tea Two.
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Un other suggestion is there is no Tea above! It just 
And For Two many things are possible; think binary, + -, Y/N,
L/R, T/F  No wonder there was Eve for Adam!
