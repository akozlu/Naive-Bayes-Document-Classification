Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters. 
The polygons are all convex. 
They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave / self intersecting polygons. 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons.  


It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms.
If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.
