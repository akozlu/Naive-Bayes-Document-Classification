I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
McGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational.  
I just said that it exists.


I don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all.   Some questions:
How tall is he?
Does he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson/Pete Rose?
Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler?
Does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat?

It could be the Cole has a good batting "eye".
Look above, I said that *many* high OBP guys draw their walks because
pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not "all" high OBP guys.
