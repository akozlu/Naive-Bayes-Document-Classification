I guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and, in
fact all year) have been pretty much consistently CORRECT.  Remember: the rule
says it's a strike if ANY PART of the ball passes through the strike zone.

I would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called (who could argue
this point?) but all in all I think in and out is called pretty well.
