You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched
in between Clark and Bonds.  He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to
hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise.
What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark
3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing
abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners.
I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the
3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 
Clark in the 5 spot.
