Not totally true.  For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box
scores from STATS, Inc.  The AP representative in the press box is actually
a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can
do it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error 
checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where
the appreveiations come in hear.  I don't think it is at STATS's.  It may
just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. 

While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new
people.  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road
to getting into the press box may be real short.  For more info, call 
STATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.  It's a fun
way to get paid for watching baseball games.

End of public service announcement.
