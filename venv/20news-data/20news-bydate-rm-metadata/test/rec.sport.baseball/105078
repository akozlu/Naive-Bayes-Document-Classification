	Don't worry.  This is a perfectly normal state of affairs.  Had they
actually been using him, you should be worried.


	He's recovered totally from his injury.  That's why he's not
pitching...so he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again
pitching on 38 days rest and then have fun dining in the Diamond Club in
Shea Stadium while AY struggles every day out there...


	I've be quite happy to drop John Franco, just the same.
	Bring back Randy Myers!
	No, better make that...Bring Back Neil Allen!
