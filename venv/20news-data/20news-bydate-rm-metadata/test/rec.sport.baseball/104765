It is ironic that in any post that criticizes langauge ability, the critic
invariably makes a mistake himself ("english" is generally written "English".)


Oddly, I do not see that I have contested any of that. Perhaps you, with 
assuredly greater "english" ability can explain, in tiny words that I might
grasp their meaning, precisely WHERE I infer that you have said any of those
things? 


No Mr Fisher, you should place the burden of proof on the one who makes the
allegation in the first place. You do not. Perhaps you might explain why that
is? As for the email route, Mr Fisher, you might have tried that yourself.
