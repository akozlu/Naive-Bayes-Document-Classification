Good question.  It's my impression, not backed by evidence, that general
south-of-the-borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring-firing effect
I was talking about.  

Back in the 20's there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers; 
they were rejected by the commissioner and others.




Well, what *did* I mean to say?  Aside from some short-lived exceptions
such as Japanese internment in WW II, only blacks were affected by laws
regarding: slavery, Jim Crow, miscegenation, military service, etc.  If
my claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come
up with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.  But compared to
this list, no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth
discussing at length.
