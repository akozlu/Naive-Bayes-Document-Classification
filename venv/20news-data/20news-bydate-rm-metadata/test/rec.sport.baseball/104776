Fine, are you willing to bet that he will bat .400 the rest of the way?

The point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far; it's that he *will* hurt
them, eventually.  Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the
past couple seasons.


It has happened for the past 3+ seasons; where have you been?


We'll see come September.  (I have an outstanding bet with someone that
Galarraga's OBP will be less than .300 on June 1.)
