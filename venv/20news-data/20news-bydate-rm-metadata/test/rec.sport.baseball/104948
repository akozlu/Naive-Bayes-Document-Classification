This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.
But the Giants are going to need every break they can get, if they
want too hold that lead.  I don't think they can afford to be
lackadaisical, and say "well it has worked pretty well so far, and
while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is
worth the risk".


The two tend to go hand in hand...
