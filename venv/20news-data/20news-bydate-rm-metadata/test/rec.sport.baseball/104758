Manny Mota.
Billy Hatcher
Herm Winningham.
Lonnie Smith (not light hitting, but a horror in the field)
Gary Redus
Dion James
Daryl Boston
Vince Coleman (yeah, he's finally started to have a decent OBP)
Cecil Espy
Willie Wilson
Gary Pettis
Milt Thompson
Gary Varsho

OK, I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook, but

Cesar Cedeno. 


Likewise for my list. Oh, and a prediction: Milt Cuyler.
