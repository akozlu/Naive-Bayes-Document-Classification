Dayley's salary was guarenteed...with Wells the Jays were only on the
hook for 25%(?) of it.

Give Jackson a break...he lost about 10 pounds with that flu he had
when he was traded.


I would rather have Molitor than Winfield...Winfield was just hogging
all the credit, and he was trying to soak the Jays for a 3 year
guarenteed contract...


The Jays pitching can only get better...Molitor and Alomar haven't hit
anything yet...and the Jays are still over .500...
