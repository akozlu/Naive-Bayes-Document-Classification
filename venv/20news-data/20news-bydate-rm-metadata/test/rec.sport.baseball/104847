You could be right.  Then again, you could be wrong.  This claim is completely
unverifiable and untestable.  I'd wager most of the Braves fans on the net
could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.

You could give away tickets to Braves games.  However, my Dad and I were able
to get great seats from scalper for face value, which isn't exactly the sign
of a hot ticket...


This is *precisely* why they were considered America's team.  Even
(especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on
cable.  You could do that for the Cubs as well, but the Braves had better
camerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss
the game, or Skip and Pete discuss motoball?), and teams that weren't *too*
much worse.  Because of TBS, the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia.
At home in Kentucky, even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was
as many Braves fans as Reds fans, even in 1990.  You could actually watch the
Braves play -- you had to go to Cincinnati to watch the Reds.  I can go
anywhere in America and watch the Braves.
    

Why?  I'd guess that Braves fans are more widely distributed than Toronto
fans.
