Are you kidding?  I'm stuck with the Toronto SkyDome, where their idea
of a 7th inning stretch is that "Blue Jays" song where everyone gets
to yell:  "Okay, okay, Blue Jays, Blue Jays, Let's Play Ball!"

Wow.. what genius did it take to compose that one, to outshine the
old classic.  And there are women on the field to "lead the crowd".
