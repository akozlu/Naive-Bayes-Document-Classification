  First, I don't expect them to love me if they don't even know I
  exist.  Secondly, I wouldn't expect them to love me simply because
  they were my creator.  I would expect to have to earn that love.


  Are you daft?  How do I love something I don't believe exists?
  Come back when you've learned to love your third testicle.


  At which point you have stepped over the line and become a
  complete asshole.  Even though it's your first offense, I won't
  let it slip becuase I've heard it too goddamned many times.

  You love Jesus because deep in your heart you're a cannibalistic
  necrophiliac.  Because I say so, and I'm much more qualified to
  assess your motivations than you are.

  Fortunately, there are some things I get to accept on evidence
  rather than faith.  One of them being that until christians like
  yourself quit being so fucking arrogant, there will never be
  peace.  You've all made sure of that.
