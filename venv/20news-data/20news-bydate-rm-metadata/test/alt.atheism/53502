Not by any standard of history I've seen. Care to back this up, sans the
lies apologists are so fond of?


Not really. Most of the prophesies aren't even prophesies. They're prayers
and comments taken from the Torah quite out of context. Seems Xians started
lying right from the beginning.


My we're an arrogant ass, aren't we?


You're wrong to think we haven't. The trust was in something that doesn't
exist.


I'm still willing to die for what I believe and don't believe. So were the
loonies in Waco. So what? 

Besides, the point's not to die for what one believes in. The point's to
make that other sorry son-of-a-bitch to die for what *he* believes in!   :)

Doesn't anyone else here get tired of these cretins' tirades?

Peter the Damed, and damned proud of it!
