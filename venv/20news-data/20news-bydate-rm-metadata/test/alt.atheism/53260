Gregg, you haven't provided even a title of an article to support *your*
contention.


You also have no reason to believe it *is* an anti-Islamic slander job, apart

Why, yes.  What's a mere report in The Times stating that BCCI followed

obviously spreading slanderous propaganda.

that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate.  Doubtless that's how
you spend your time in soc.culture.islam.
