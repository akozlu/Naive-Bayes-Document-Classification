Which newsgroup have you been reading?  The few anti-Christian posts are
virtually all in response to some Christian posting some "YOU WILL ALL
BURN IN HELL" kind of drivel.
 
 
Bake, it is transparently obvious that you are a theist pretending to be
an atheist.  You probably think you are very clever, but we see this all
the time.
 
 
But of course *you* have dismissed them because you are an atheist,
right?
 
 
In other words, you *didn't* read the FAQ after all.
