Well, as I remember Jacoby's "Mythmaker" talks about this to cite
one source -- but I'm not sure if all Christians have read this book.
In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated
as a Lutheran, having a lot of Christian friends, and I even
have played in two Christian rock bands!

So, over to you, do you have any counter claims, sources et 
rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept
of a social promise that is independent on the social status?

Cheers,
Kent
