I and many others on a.a have described how we have tried to find god.
Are you saying our efforts have not been sincere?  For all the effort
I have put in, there has been no outward nor inward change that I can
perceive.  What's a sincerely searching Agnostic or Atheist supposed to
do when even the search turns up nothing?


How do you "accept that which you don't know"?  Do you mean that I must
believe in your god in order to believe in your god?
