In the part of the posting you have so helpfully deleted, I 
pointed out that they used the wording from the English Bill of
Rights apparently *changing* what they understood by it, and I
asked why then should we, two hundred years later, be bound by
what Keith Allan Schneider *thinks* they understood by it.


So one cannot say "a cruel fate"?

Your prevarications are getting increasingly unconvincing, I think.
