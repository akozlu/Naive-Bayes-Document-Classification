    What do you accept as a fact --  the roundness of the earth (after 
all, the ancient Greeks thought it was a sphere, and then Newton said 
it was a spheroid, and now people say it's a geoid [?])?  yourself 
(isn't your personal identity just a theoretical construct to make 
sense of memories, feelings, perceptions)?  I'm trying to think of 
anything that would be a fact for you.  Give some examples, and let's
see how factual they are by your criteria (BTW, what are your
criteria?).

    "Gravity is _not_ a fact": is that a fact?  How about Newton's 
and Einstein's thoughts about gravity -- is it a fact that they had 
those thoughts?  I don't see how any of the things that you are 
asserting are any more factual than things like gravity, atoms or 
evolution.

    In short, before I am willing to consider your concept of what
a fact is, I'm going to have to have, as a minimum, some examples of
what you think are facts.
