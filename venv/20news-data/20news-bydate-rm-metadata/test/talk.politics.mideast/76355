I couldn't agree more.  Canada has an anti-hate law which exists to punish
those who wilfully spread false propaganda (lies) for the purpose of 
putting down another group.  This is actually the law that David Irving
will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust.
It's too bad that this useless "Centre for Policy Research" isn't in Canada.
It'd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace.
