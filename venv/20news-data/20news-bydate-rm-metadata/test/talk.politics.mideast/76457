Dear Elias, 

I counted at least 4 such answers in public (plus whatever private
email replies you may have received), yet you refuse to accept
anything.  Perhaps you are better off in the private world of the
"Center for Policy Research" in Iceland where you can define
"sensible" in whatever way makes you feel most comfortable.
