I believe that things are getting mixed here.
Critizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing "the absolute 
negatives of that culture". Maybe, because a person can see the positives 
of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
State of Israel.
I, for one, consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to
the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of 
respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion, segregation and
years in the diaspora.



He might not want to recognize that. It does not make him a self-hating
Jew, as far as I see it. At most, he is a person who is not telling
the truth.



But, so far, it seems that the blame is always put on "the other".
If you read this newsgroup, for example, Israel is never guilty by
herself. She is always responding to the actions of the "other", and
it goes as if the actions of Isreal do not also affect the response
of the "other' in a cycle that never ends. Also, there is blindness to
try to understand what the other feels and why.
There is always and excuse. There is always a rationale to explain why
things happen as they do.
And, what is the worst part for me, there seems to be all the time an
intention to try to de-humanize the "other", as if the other did not
care about their future, children, peace, etc, etc.
