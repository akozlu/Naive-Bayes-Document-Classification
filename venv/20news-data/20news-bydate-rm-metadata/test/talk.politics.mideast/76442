I think the answer to Mr. Mayamsky's question can be found in the
first amendment to the US Constitution.

	Amendment I                                           (1791)

	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
	religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
	abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the
	right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
	the government for a redress of grievances.
