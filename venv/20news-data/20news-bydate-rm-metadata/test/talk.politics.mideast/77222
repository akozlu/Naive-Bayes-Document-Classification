You are not sticking to the original question. Imagine what it
would be like if you were human...impossible you say?



Is that not the crux of my argument? Why is this so difficult
for you to understand? Lack of intelligence?



Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion
and national origin?

1) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of Van.[1,2,3,4,5]
2) Armenians did slaughter 42% of Muslim population of Bitlis.[1,2,3,4]
3) Armenians did slaughter 31% of Muslim population of Erzurum.[1,2,3,4]
4) Armenians did slaughter 26% of Muslim population of Diyarbakir.[1,2,3,4]
5) Armenians did slaughter 16% of Muslim population of Mamuretulaziz.[1,2,3,4]
6) Armenians did slaughter 15% of Muslim population of Sivas.[1,2,3,4]
7) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of the x-Soviet
   Armenia.[1,2,3,4]

"They [Armenians] did not refrain from giving in to their racial 
 hatred and committing acts of cruelty and massacres against the
 Moslem population, which were encouraged by the 'Tashnak' party,
 mortal enemies of Turkey."
