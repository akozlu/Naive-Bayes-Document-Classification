You've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide. 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But
there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
"the people" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals
call all the Bosnian Muslims "Turks" even though they are not ethnically
Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously "other" is called, paradoxically, "ethnic
cleansing" rather than "religious cleansing."

Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.
