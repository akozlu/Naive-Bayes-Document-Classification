There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean,
however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The
entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews
to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.

On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the
best of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies
of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and
bigotry.
