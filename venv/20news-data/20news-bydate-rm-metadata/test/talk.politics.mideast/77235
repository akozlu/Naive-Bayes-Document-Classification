The NY Times is in error. This is not simply my opinion; even the Arab sources
that I use do not make this claim. This, of course, is assuming that the NY
Times was refering to the islands that I named above. Of those islands, only
Abu Musa has been in dispute and Iranian occupation of that island predates
the existence of the UAE.
