About 2 years ago, there was a lot of noise about a Church in the Old
City of Jerusalem being taken over by a Jewish group.  In fact, the
building in question was a dormitory that belonged to a church and was 
not physically connected to any church.  It had been leased to a
Palestinean Arab for 99 years and a Jewish group sub-leased it from
him.  The church that owned the building disapproved and legal action
was started to revoke the sub-lease.  The media, however, made it look
like Jewish vigilantes were stealing Church property in Jerusalem by
force. 


The damage has already been done by the press in the above case.  It
is not surprising by now, of course, that many "decent people" regard
the press "with utmost suspicion".


You appear to be referring to Moshe Dayan.  How do you know that the
"evicted Jordanians" were not provided with something else?  In fact,
this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
not own but received compensation for their loss, anyways!  Woe to
Jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
by force (with "ethnic cleansing" of any remaining Jews) is
"disgusting and shameful".
