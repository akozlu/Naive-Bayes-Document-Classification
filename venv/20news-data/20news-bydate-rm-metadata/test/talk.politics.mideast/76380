In fact, this "productive human presence" in the desert has, in the
centuries it has been there, produced one of the greatest
civilizations in human history.  They not only created the wheel, but
the printing press, the light bulb, Post-Modern skyscraper
architecture, Broadway theatre and nuclear power, as well.


Right, Elias.  The Negev was a veritable Garden of Eden until the Evil
Jews turned off the rain and turned it into a horrible desert.  Part
of the International Jewish Conspiracy.  Say, who should I call to
turn off the rain here in NY, right now?


Yeah, deserts rarely look like the Garden of Eden.


This is why Nature Reserves people are heavily armed with anti-tank
weaponry.  Just what we need in the Nature Reserves.


Nothing like "vast nuclear reactors" when it comes to hiding them from
air attack.  AT least Saddam had the sense to hide his CBN plants in
"baby milk" factories.


Indeed, many older people recall fondly those lovely tomatoes and
oranges that the Bedouin exported form their Garden of Eden.  In fact,
that region used to supply the entire world with bananas, until the
Jews pushed that business onto the "banana republics".




Elias, you're stupid postings are a source of considerable amusement
and hilarity.  Please don't stop.  I might even have to go back to
watching TV.
