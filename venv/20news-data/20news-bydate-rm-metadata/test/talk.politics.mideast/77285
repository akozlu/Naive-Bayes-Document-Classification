It looks like Ben Baz's mind and heart are also blind, not only his eyes.
I used to respect him, today I lost the minimal amount of respect that

To All Muslim netters: This is the same guy who gave a "Fatwah" that
Saudi Arabia can be used by the United Ststes to attack Iraq . That
Fatwah is as legitimate as this one. With that kind of "Clergy", it might
be an Islamic duty to separate religion and politics, if religion
means "official Clergy".
