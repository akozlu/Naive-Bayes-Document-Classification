Sealing off the Gaza Strip has the interesting side-effect of
demonstrating the non-viability of Gaza as an independent state.
Where are all of these people going to go to find work if they are
separated from Israel?  If they complain about having to show id cards
on the way to work, how will they feel about showing passports on the
way to work?
