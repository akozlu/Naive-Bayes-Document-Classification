First, the following two quite normal phrases:    

       ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^   

and then he shows us what HE means by "intelligent and unoffending manner" 
and "INTELLIGENT conversation":   

                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   [...deleted lines...]

                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   [...deleted lines...]      

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
   [...deleted lines...]
                                                    

   Later he reveals the truth:

                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
   [...deleted lines...] 

   Shurely he IS an anti-Semite (call it anti-Jew), maybe BECAUSE he
   is "part Jewish"  (e.g. his mother might have *dated*  a Jew who
   didn't marry her, and so she got a little bastard whom she taught
   hatred).  
   
   He is also a coward since he doesn't dare to sign with his name.  
   At the end he signs with a highly intelligent and intellectual 
   phrase:

   The  Nazis  might also have sent this bastard to the gas chambers
   because of his "part Jewish"ness (only that he is not aware of it).   

PS: I wonder what kind of educational institution is @virginia.edu.
    Could it be the "Free KKK-University of Virginia" ? ;-)
