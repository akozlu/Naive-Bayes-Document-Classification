	used to commerate Americans or better yet, to house
	homeless Americans.


jim@specialix.com (Jim Maurer) responds:

	Why don't you contribute to a group helping the
	homeless if you so concerned?


Jack Schmidling (arf@genesis.MCS.COM) reveals the true depths
of his cynicism:

	I do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but
	when interest rates plumetted, I just paid it off.

	The problem is, I couldn't convince Congress to move
	my home to a nicer location on Federal land.


In other words, Mr. Schmidling could care less for the plight
of the homeless, but is not above using them to score points
for his agenda.
