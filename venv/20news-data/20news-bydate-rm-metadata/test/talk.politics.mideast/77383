can anybody guess this from the title?

Not me, I thought that a clash between Israelis and Arabs resulted
in four deaths on one side and two on the other.


How about being illegally settled there?
I am not sure about the signals the Israelis are sending, one day
they are willing to accept a Jordan/West Bank federation, the other
they do not recognize the west bank as occupied territory (neither
did the U.S, "the honest brocker")
(details of the killings omitted, PLO,Hamas graffiti both claim responsability)


Now don't tell me that this could not be an Israeli spy.
We will know later.
