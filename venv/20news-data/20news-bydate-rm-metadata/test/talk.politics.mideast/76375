	None of you guys noticed my "Gross Mistake" 'cause you
don't have a clue. I noticed the misspeaking myself and
corrected it. I doubt you would have ever noticed.

	Actually I've read books and taken courses on the
subject. Ah yes and like you lived in the greater Deutschland. 
 

You guys are funny. It's funny to see people lose control and
start the name calling when they realize they have no point.


Could have fooled me.

	I understand how individual liberties (freedom of
speach, religion etc.) could be a thing you "never heard
about". Actually, Civil Libertarians believe in the fundamental
freedoms that belong to human beings. They would support the
Jews against the Nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them
and they would support the Arabs against the Israelis and any
other such oppressive regimes (Iraq etc.) 



Well actually now that you mentioned here are a few things I
appreciate:

1. Politeness
2. Stimulating conversation
3. A red rose
4. New York in june and a good Gerschwinn tune
5. A chocalate Sundae
6. Really angry out of controll funny people
