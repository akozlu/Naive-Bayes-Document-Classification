Muslims,

This kind of racialist generalization is utterly inappropriate.  SOME
Bosnian Muslims cooperated with the Nazis in World War 2.  Other Bosnian
Muslims risked their lifes to hide Jews from the Nazis and Ustashe, and
those Jews who survived the war remember that.  In fact the Jewish leader
in Sarajevo has remained there saying he wants to repay the debt to the
Bosnian Muslims that saved so many Jewish lives in WW2.

Similarly, SOME Serbs are "doing" to Muslims now. This is a group of
serial-killers, rapists, and thieves who have control of the vast
Yugoslav army arsenal.  Many other Serbs oppose these atrocities.  As one
of Serbian heritage who condemns emphatically the genocide being carried
out against Muslims by both HVO and Mladic forces, I condemn your
generalization about Bosnian Muslims and about Serbs.


 This is not a fresh case of

Every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and
destruction.  The holocaust was not a "fresh case."  It was another
chapter in a 900 year history of attacks on Jews in Europe.  That didn't
make it acceptable. and Balkan history does not make the genocide against
Bosnian Muslims acceptable.

Not taking sides in this

Standing by and allowing well-armed criminals to slaughter Bosnian Muslim
civilians, while enforcing an arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims is
not only religious bigotry it is direct complicity in mass-murder.


 It could just

You tell us a region on earth that does have a long history of war.  NATO
is the largest military "police force" in the world.  It was not
"helpless."  It could have stopped the carnage a year ago.
