I can certainly see opposing the "Amen" -- but that doesn't require 
opposing a moment of silence.


Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here?  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer aren't going to back off when
they can't even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently.
