Ah, you taking everything as literal quotation.  No wonder you're confused.

First, can I ask that we decide on a definition of "objective"?


And?


I'd guess that it might be.


It may be the case that some people are unable to evaluate complex moral
issues.  Rather than leaving them to behave "immorally", it might be better
to offer them an abstract (nonexistent objective) system of ethics which they
can strive towards, coded into rules which they don't have to derive for
themselves.

I tend to feel that this is pretty much what we all have as morality
anyway...
