Someone stated that the Davidian cult should not be associated
with Christianity. Well, I read all those four postings, and I'm
now even more convinced that Davididians are truly Christian
in nature. But sometimes it makes sense to re-label the cult, 
especially if the ugliness is too much to handle.

Cheers,
Kent
