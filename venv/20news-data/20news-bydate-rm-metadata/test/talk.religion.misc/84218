=Hmm.  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as
=officers and yelling "Police" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug
=houses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and
=display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's
=a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even
=fight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so
=commonly, now would it?

How often is it used when the convoy carrying the brigade is visible for miles
before it reaches the place that's to be searched?
