If you say X statement and give it the authority of fact, I will respond
by asking you why. You aren't obligated to say anything, but if your
intent is to convince me that X statement is true, then yes, the burden
of proof is upon you. 

If you are merely giving testimony to your beliefs, then you are an egotist.
Why would I care?

To surmise, the burden of proof is upon you if you wish us to believe that
what you say is true.
