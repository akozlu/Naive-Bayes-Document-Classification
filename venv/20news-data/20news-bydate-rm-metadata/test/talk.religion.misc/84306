I see what you are getting at (or at least I think I do).  Correct me if
I am mistaken, but I *think* you are asking me if I still believe that we
should uphold all of the Laws pertaining to capital punishment for such
things as adultery, rape and other heinous crimes.  As you may recall,
Jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress
who was caught in the act and brought before Jesus.  And His reply, "Let
he who is without sin cast the first stone."  Jesus does not deny the
sentence that is to due for this violation of the Law.  What do you think
of this?


Agreed.  :)
 

Agreed also.  If one is to use the Bible as a reference, one must always be
open to different interpretations.  As a Christian, I have the Spirit of God
to verify what I believe in the Word.  If what the Spirit tells me is not
backed up in scripture then the spirit I am communicating with is not of
God.  After all, Jesus tells us to "test the spirits" to know for sure that
it is from God.


I obey what the Spirit of God tells me to do.  The Spirit will not violate
anything that is written in the Bible because that is the Word of God.  I do
not worship pastors, preachers, my wife, my mother or my father.  What they
tell me does not carry the weight of what God tells me to do and His commands
are rienforced in the Bible.
 

Eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting
God.  If you choose to jump off a cliff, you can hardly blame God for you 
going *splat* at the bottom.  He knows that if you choose to jump, that 
you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice.  In fact,
He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what
lies below.  To prove that point, Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being
God was able to rise up again.  I have seen the example of Christ and have 
chosen not to jump and I'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll 
go *splat*.
 
You don't have to listen to me and I won't stop you if you decide to jump.
I only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge.  You owe it to
yourself.  I don't like seeing anyone go *splat*.

God be with you,
