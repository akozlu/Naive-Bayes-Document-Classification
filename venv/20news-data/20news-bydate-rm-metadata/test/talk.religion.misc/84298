Um, I think you and the Bible are the ones inside the wall.  There's a
really wonderful world out here.  You really should peek out at it sometime.

The silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we *are*
on opposite sides of a very high wall.  I see how incredibly beautiful
things are on my side, and I only keep telling you about it because
I'd like to you come join me here.


I never said that.  I said that I would PREFER to cease to exist than
to be tossed into any god's version of Hell.


You say to me, "Brian, come up here and take a look from this vantage
point."  But you're in a valley, looking at a crayon drawing of a sun
and a tree, and I can't for the life of me figure out why you're so
immersed in it.  *I*'m the one trying to get you to come up HERE,
don't you see?
