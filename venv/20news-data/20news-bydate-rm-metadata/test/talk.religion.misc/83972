You have clearly demonstrated that you do not even know
what my religion is in order to make that assumption.


How I can present any argument when you put your hands over your
eyes and devise new irrevelant excuses each time?  The fact remains,
you want to argue about something that you do not know anything about.
Do you not have to learn a topic first before you can reasonably debate
the topic?  

Which brings us about to the start of this thread.  You began
perverting Bible verses, interpreting them without investigation.
For if you desired to investigate, you would have changed your
tune immediately.   Thus it is clear to me.  You do not believe
what I am saying because "you don't want to" check it out.


Then you must have also ignored every other post I have written
to you.  This would seem to go along with your character.
