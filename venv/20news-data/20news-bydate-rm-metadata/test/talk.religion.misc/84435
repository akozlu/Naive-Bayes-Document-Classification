It seems you lived a fairly 'wild life'-- my background is far more
traditional, mostly working, working, working. Maybe there's a clear
indication that the way you lived your life produced a certain 
amount of anxiety that needed to be released. Religion was one
possible medicine. While my more stable environment didn't and 
still does not produce the situation where I feel such guilt.

This is just one possible explanation why you feel this burden,
while I haven't felt it so far.

Kent
