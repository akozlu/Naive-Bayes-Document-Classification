                                             
I'm curious.  Are you referring to Koresh as "the Man"?  Why the 
upper case M?                           
                                                         
                                                          
I never claimed to be a spokesman for "most people".  It is an assumption
on my part that people with normal values and morality would be more 
concerned with human life than sermon structure.  
                                      
                     
Are burning children part of this very special event?      
                                          

                                                
What about those who do not know the Master's voice?  Does the Master
not care about them?  Eloquent, but corrupt, preaching may be of little
difference to you.  But I suspect it made a big difference to all of
those who died in the compound.
