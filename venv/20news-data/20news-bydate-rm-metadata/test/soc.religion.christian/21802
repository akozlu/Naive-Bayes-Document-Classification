[ in response to a question about why Jesus' parents would be sanctified 
beyond normal humanity]

I would think that simply being pregnant with the incarnation of the 
Almighty God would be enough to make Mary blessed among all women, whether
or not she had special spiritual attributes.  I find that the more special
Mary needs to be, the less human Jesus gets.
