The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were (or are) monophysite is 
false, as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon 
was Nestorian.

These misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors, and thus led 
to schism - a schism that is on its way to being healed.
