Before you finalize your file in the FAQs (or after), you might want to 
correct the typo in the following:


It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with 
"homosexual".

As a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work 
entering human life as a result of sin.  
 
Before the fall (Gen 2:15) "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into 
the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." which I would call "work".  
For me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added 
at the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the 
work for sustenance).  In a way, some view "work" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes 
is a fun book! - for melancholies).

I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.

Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what 
you state as your purpose "It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian 
homosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.

I wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific 
homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).
  Perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or 
refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid 
heterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it 
was worth"?
