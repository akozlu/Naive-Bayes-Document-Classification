	+  I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and
	+ between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall
	+ crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.
	+ -Genesis 3.15

   In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.

	+ HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel.

   The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.
