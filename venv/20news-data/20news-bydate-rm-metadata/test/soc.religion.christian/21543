From what I understand of my experience in looking up this word, and 
discussing it with a Greek-literate individual, the meaning of the 
word is rather clear.  Basically it literally means "he who beds with a man"
or "he who has sex with a man."  The burden of proof is on the 
pro-homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an 
idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning.  One can speculate
all day long that it might mean something else, but we need evidence
before we create new doctrines, and get rid of the historical understanding
of the meaning of this word.
