...

I have seen it used in an Orthodox church once, although I can't recall why.
I found it odd, to say the least.  Also, I object to the statement that the
Orthodox DELETE the filioque from the original form of the Creed.

The creed originally did NOT contain that phrase, and it is not present
in the Greek original, which hangs by my desk.  Not intending to start a
flame war.  We didn't need to delete what wasn't there.
