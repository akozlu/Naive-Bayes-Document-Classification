Are you sure you want to include Chalcedon here?  I presume that you 
mean the description of Jesus as fully human and fully devine.  Almost 
everyone would consider the majority of Copts and Armenians, and the 
Jacobites, as Christians, yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained 
that they disagree with the Formula of Chalcedon.  Those that wouldn't 
consider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities 
don't require a personal commitment to Jesus, which is only tangentially 
related to the Formula of Chalcedon.
