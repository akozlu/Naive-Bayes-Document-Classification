   The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and are able to change
what happens to us.  However, since God knows everything, He knows all
the choices we will make "in advance" (God is not subject to time).  Too
often arguments pit predestination against free will.  We believe in
both.
