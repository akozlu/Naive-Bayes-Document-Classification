Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican
variant you bring up.

That is, many (not all) extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of
teaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment.
I do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse.

It is indeed this judgemental, controlling legalism of many fundamentalist
Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true
to the Gospel of Christ, the gospel of love.

I have seen this sort of thing too often, even amoung my own relatives, to
believe there is no relationship.  Judgementalism often leads to overly
strict, and thus abusive, discipline of children.
[This is not restricted to just Christian fundamentalism, it is found in
many extreme sects of other legalistic religions].

I, too, am a Christian.  But I do not condone the use of the Bible to justify
this sort of abuse.  I believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of
the misapplication of the Biblical concept of discipline that such abuses
can be stopped.

Just because someone is also a Christian does not mean we must identify
eith them. This sort of sin needs to be made public.
