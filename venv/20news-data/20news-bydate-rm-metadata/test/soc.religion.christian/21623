(I presume you are quoting John 3:3-7.)

1.  My King James Bible says "Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" 
(John 3:5).  (Here "man" == "adult").
(However, this could be a quibble between translations.)

2.  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing:
"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again"
(John 3:7).  Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks
to Nicodemus -- a ruler of the Jews (not a child).

3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even 
introduce the concept of spiritual re-birth through
baptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin?
