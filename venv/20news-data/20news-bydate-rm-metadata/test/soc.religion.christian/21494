I wouldn't and don't.  I thought I did a pretty good job of
qualifying my statement, but apparently some people
misinterpreted my intentions.  I apologize for my part in
communicating any confusion.  My intent was more to
stir up discussion rather than judge.   It seems to
have worked.

[rest of post noted - by the way, I did not originally post this to
alt.atheism.  If it got there, I don't know how it did.]
