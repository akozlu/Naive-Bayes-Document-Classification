: Okay Claytoon, let us say that hypothetically I agree with you that
: gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men.  Why does
: this indicate they are screwed up people?

: BTW - It occurs to me that since, in my experience, men are much more
:       interested in sex than women and want to have sex much earlier
:       in a relationship than women do, that homosexuals would have 
:       sex more often simply becuase their partner is of a like mind.
:       i.e. heterosexual men would be more promiscuous if they could.

It's my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly
indoctronated into now wanting sex that are men.
Also there are definite double standards for men and women who are
promiscuous.

Could there also be a factor of communication being more direct in 
homosexual relationships and culture.
