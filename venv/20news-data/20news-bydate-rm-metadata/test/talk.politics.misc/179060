Local media hasn't said much, if anything, about the MOW.  Also, when
I called a straight friend in Arlington to tell him I would be on his
doorstep this weekend, he didn't know anything at all about the march.
This is a gay-sympathetic person who notices things like this.  I
thought it was strange that he was unaware of what was happening.  It
made me wonder just how much coverage is getting to "mainstream" America.
