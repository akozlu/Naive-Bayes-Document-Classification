  Do we want to 'create jobs'? or do we want jobs created that are productive
  in our supply/demand economy? If your answer is the former then we can
  just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in
  the desert. If you answer the latter then I fail to see how another
  bureaucracy produces anything.
