The fact that Reno is actually taking responsibility (gee--that's a new
one for a politician) is a new thing for a member of Clinton's administration.
I actually respect her for having a backbone ( I never thought I'd say
that about someone from that bunch).

The way I understand what happened is that she discussed with Clinton
what was being planned for Waco.  Clinton didn't say no, so gave de
facto approval for the operation.  Things got messed up, and a lot of
people died horrible deaths.  (if I am incorrect about this, please 
feel free to correct it.  This is just what I've been able to pick 
up.)

I've just got a couple of questions about this whole thing.
(1)  Why did the government feel they needed to assault that compound?
(2)  Why didn't they try to flush them out in the first week of
     this fiasco instead of waiting 50 days.
(3)  Janet Reno jumped up to take responsibilty to take heat away
     from the President.  Does this sound anything like what a couple
     of Reagan's aides did?
