Wait a second, you're ignoring major facts here.

There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant. The BATF had a
no-knock warrant. The initial firefight began when the BATF threw
concussion grenades at the building. (BATF admits this!)


Let's be realistic here, shall we?

You're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization. Someone
comes to your building, dressed in black suits, carrying firearms.
They throw a concussion grenade at the place, and try to break in.
What, exactly, are you going to do?

I would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying
themselves. If someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing
explosive, I think I'd be entirely justified in defending myself.

Regardless of what I think of the BDs, and regardless of whether or
not they were guilty of firearms violations, this is NOT the way you
treat people in a supposedly free society.
