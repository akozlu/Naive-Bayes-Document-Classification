We have three options with respect to the Constitution:

1. Abide by it.
2. Duly amend it.
3. Abandon those parts of which a majority disapproves.

Of course, since the whole point of the Constitution is to restrain the
will of the majority, and since even in unfettered democracy we have 
nothing to fear from minorities, #3 amounts to abandoning the 
Constitution altogether.

Which will it be?
