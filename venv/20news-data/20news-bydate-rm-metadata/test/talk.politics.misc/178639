 The above statement ignores reality. The BD WERE provoked.




 Damn, Phil. You must have seen a different tape of the initial raid than
I did. Your `doorbell' happened to include lobbing percussion grenades and
attempting to storm the compound through the windows. I can honestly say
I have never seen a `doorbell' that works like that.





  THINK, man. The BATF are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might
 have illegal automatic weapons. If they expected, as you state, that `the B-D
 to be anything other than peaceful citizens' they could have sent one, maybe 
 two agents up to the front door, knock, and attempt to serve the warrant on
 the person answering the door. Scenario one, that person lets them in to 
 perform the search and no one gets hurt. Scenario two, the person answering
 the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers. Now you have two dead BATF
 agents instead of four, the BATF knows exactly where they stand with regards
 to the BD and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible
 without harm to the innocent people/children within the compound.




 No, the stupidity was the attempt to serve the warrant SWAT style.




 Sure, do it within the law. The BATF is there to uphold the law, not
 circumvent it to fit their needs.....
