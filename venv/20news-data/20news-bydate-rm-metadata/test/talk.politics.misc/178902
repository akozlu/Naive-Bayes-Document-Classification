That people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might
be considered an acceptable scenario in storming a compound. 

When EVERYONE dies (save for nine people), including twenty children, the 
outcome must be considered a failure.

Now was the failure due to unforseeable circumstances, incompetence, or
negligence?  From the double talk and multiple stories I've seen on the news
coming from the FBI and Reno I find "it was an honest mistake" hard to swallow

Let's hope they get their stories straight for the second round of questions.
