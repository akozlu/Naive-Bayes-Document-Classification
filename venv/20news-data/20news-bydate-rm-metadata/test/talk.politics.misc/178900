You have yet to answer any or all of my questions and challenges to your 
statements.  By this am I to assume that you are unable to do so?  Or just
plain unwilling due to your lack of proof/intelligence?  So what next?  I 
prove you wrong so you just put me in your killfile?

Your lack of reasoned response seems to be a typical Clayton response.
