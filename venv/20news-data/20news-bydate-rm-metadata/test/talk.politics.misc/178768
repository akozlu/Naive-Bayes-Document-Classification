Hey don't confuse these guys with facts dude! You might break some
beautiful illusions!

Of course by BATF admits this they mean that the BATF did not deny some
post by a pro-Koresh/gun lobby person some time back.

If anyone wants to understand the paranoid mindset of Koresh I offer you
talk.politics.guns. There you can dredge the sewers of minds so hung
up on power and ego trips that they bend reality arround their own
particular set of beleifs.

I long ago gave up arguing the case for arms control directly. Instead
I invite people to ask themselves, would you want to be in a room full
of the occupants of talk.politics.guns, their personal armouries and
attempt to enter a discussion with them?
