NOT an accurate analogy. David Koresh did not take a bunch of
hostages and then call the BATF with a ransom note. You make
it sound as if the BATF showed up to save those children in the
first place. I have some interesting news for youBATF
has absolutely NO jurisdiction in child abuse cases. 

It seems to me that the BATF showed up, took the Davidians hostage. 
Then the FBI showed up, negotiated to have a few of the hostages 
released, but were unable to keep the BATF from killing the rest 
of the poor people trapped inside the compound.
