## Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....

#Not surprising.  Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.

Err, earth to Clayton, you posted this to show that 2% were
homosexual. So if we assume EVERY homosexual was promiscious, that
leads us to conclude that 23 percent of heterosexuals are promiscious.
And that first assumtion is a bad one.

Clayton, it *IS* suprising from the claims you are making.
