  I thumbed through the Janus Report in a bookstore recently looking
  for a clue about their methodology.   They were very unclear about
  it, but as far as I could tell they relied on their professional
  associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects,
  interviews, and numbers.    If so, this would hardly represent an
  average cross-section.    I posted to Usenet at the time asking for
  more data about their methodology but answer came there none.  (I
  must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information
  on Usenet!)



  This is the problem.  People have to have a lot of confidence in 
  the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak 
  freely about stuff like that.    But I agree that if someone's 
  going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming
  to be straight rather than the other way around.



  I don't see why there's any more evidence for this figure than any
  other.    It seems totally arbitrary.
