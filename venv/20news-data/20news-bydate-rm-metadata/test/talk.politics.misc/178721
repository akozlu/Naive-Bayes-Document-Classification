Atomic Energy Commision - Hmm, they would say this.

The Earth may spew alot of substances into the atmosphere, but the quality 
of your toxic output can easily make up for the lack of quantity.  Furthermore, 
the planet is a system of carbon, sulfur and other chemicals which have been
acting for billions of years, we are but newcomers to the system - we must adapt
and control in order to bring about stability.  Also, two wrongs do not make a right, 
so continuing our practices despite overwhelming data is just ignorance in (non)action.


Educated and open minded environmentalists do not.
