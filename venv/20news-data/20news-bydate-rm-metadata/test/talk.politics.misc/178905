[re Michael Friedman and Phil Ronzone]

Try asking Michael whether he still thinks the M-16 "is one of the
most beautiful machines around."  Or ask Phil if he still claims that
the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the 14th amendment
apply to the federal government.  The responses should be as
enlightening as the recent name-calling, and about as relevant.
