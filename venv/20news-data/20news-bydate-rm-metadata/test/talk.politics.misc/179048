Mr. Kuo: I don't recall seeing your byline around much before (at least
on t.p.m). Let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated
largely by people whose hatred for the U.S. government, especially
the government of Mr. Clinton, is literally boundless. To these
people, the suggestion that agents of the U.S. government would carry
out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of TV
cameras, is not an 'extraordinary claim'. It's just another day in
the life of these United States.

They don't have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to
publicly massacre citizens. Have you seen 'The Crying Game'?
