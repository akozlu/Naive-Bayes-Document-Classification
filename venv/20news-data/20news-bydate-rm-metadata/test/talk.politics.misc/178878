I find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million
queers in the march on Washington.  The largest figure I've seen in
the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers. :)

For another thing, 1% of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6.  Maybe
that's where you got the 2.5 million number.  Also, the number cited
in the actual report is 1.5% so that would be about 3.75 million.

As for this march on Washington, I wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time.  Last time, for the
pro-abortion rally, they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up.  That and all the stories coming out of how
the press "slants" the news really makes one wonder who's watching
the watchers.
