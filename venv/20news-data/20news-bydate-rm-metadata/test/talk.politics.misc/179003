     Really now.  Why is this the pot calling the kettle black?  I am stating
that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that
his opinion should be ignored.  Clayton is stating that a group of at least
two million (1%) American citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters.

     Here's a hypothetical question...  If Clayton said something like "all
those niggers are really stupid."  (Please don't be offended, I'm not racist
but merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic).  And then said he
read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, I
bet he wouldn't have your support.  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *PERSONALLY* having a single
homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him.
