Hi,

I've tried to get rid off XDM's ugly Login window by giving it a 'cool'
backgroundPixmap ressource. As Login is derived from Core, this should be
possible. Anyway, setting xlogin*backgroundPixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not
produce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and
explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing, too.

Any way to do it ?
