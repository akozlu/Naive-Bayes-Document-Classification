Hello Xperts out there.
I've just built X11R5 for SunOS 4.1.1/SPARC.
I have gcc-2.2 and I'd like to use its 64-bit capability
to generate an X11 release which will render to the frame
buffer using store-double (64-bit) machine code.
Can anyone tell me which directories/source files/
compiler switches to begin with?

thanks in advance
