Check into the vopl and vogle libraries.  I beleive that I still have
them available on ftp.c-mols.siu.edu but I'm not sure.  I haven't seen
any new announcements for the software but I'm sure it's still around.

I have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as
just for producing graphs after the fact.  It works well and supports
numerous graphics output formats (including X.)  I tried it and liked
it.  YOu may as well.
