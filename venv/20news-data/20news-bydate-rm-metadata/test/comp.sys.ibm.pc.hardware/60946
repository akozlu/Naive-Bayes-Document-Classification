There's also a program called ODYSSEY (MODEM directory on the Simtel
archives) that emulates MNP 4 and 5 (others, too, I think, but these were
what I was interested in).  I was getting a lot of garbage when I called
one number, and MNP 4 cleared it up completely on my ordinary 2400 modem.
(Fortunately, the remote end had an MNP modem.)

I tried MNP 5, too, but it seemed to lock up the computer.  Your mileage
may vary.
