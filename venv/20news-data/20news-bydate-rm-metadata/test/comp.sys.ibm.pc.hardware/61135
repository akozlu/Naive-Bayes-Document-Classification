I have both!

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box.

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it
has a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape.

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy
does have a 9ms average seek time. I.E it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms
Toshiba drive.


I don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus :-(


890KB/s is pretty good...


Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu
drive for an example!


I use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and no-name IDE cards on both.


Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!
