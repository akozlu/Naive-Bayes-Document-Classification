is this the KX-P1124 you're talking about?  or is there a KX-1124, too?
I'll assume you just forgot the P....


this light is also the power light.....  on (not blinking) just means that
the power is turned on.  if you look at the panel, it should read

      POWER
      ---------
      PAPER OUT

right?


don't know why it would do this, unless you're out of paper, that is.


when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
light (which, when flashing, doubles as paper out) should light, and a few
seconds later, the green ONLINE light should come on.

hope this helps.....
