Another possibility is, that you did not give your email address as password
for the anonymous account. If you that, you see following message:

230-
230-You entered an invalid/inpropable password, and are now accessing
230-restricted subset of files.    Please read README for more information.
230-We have special access features, see file README

This can happen, if your terminal emulator does not generate the '@'
character as you think (it is hard to see, since passwords are not echoed..).
