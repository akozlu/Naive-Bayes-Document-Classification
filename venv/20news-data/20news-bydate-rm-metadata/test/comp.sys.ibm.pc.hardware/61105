I currently have a AD-lib card, it can play .mid files in windows
but it cannot play the startup .wav files.. 
i called microsoft... no help.
i cannot call ad-lib since they went belly up.

does anyone know if there are special drivers that i need for this?
if so, where are they?

Thanx in ad-libvance!! :-)
