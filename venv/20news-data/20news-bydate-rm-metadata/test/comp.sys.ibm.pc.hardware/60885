As an earlier post noted - through DMA.



Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer. If I have four sources of
DMA requests ready, the DMA would service the one after the other. If
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISA/DMA
bandwidth, this will work.

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller.
