Does anybody have a data-sheet handly for the above-mentioned card?  I
bought one, sans manual at a local surplus shop, and want to try it out
with the Crywyr packet driver suite.  

The IRQ and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but I
don't grok the settings of W10-W18 (also labelled A15 through A18).
Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond
to what I/O addresses?

Is there anything else about this card I should know, before I
plug&play?
