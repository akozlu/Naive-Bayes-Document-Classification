: Hello *.*,
: I'm looking for a supplier of Archive tape drive controlers (European
: preferred) who could provide me an SC400S card for my old 5945l-2 drive.
: Who knows where I could find such a beast? I thank you in advance for your 
: attention...

I'm similarly looking for controllers for Archive 5945c.  Even the number to
contact Archive (or whatever the company is called) would help.
