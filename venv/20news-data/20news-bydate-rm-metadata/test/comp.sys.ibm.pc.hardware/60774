Well, I tried this method based on responses from several people.  Either
I am a klutz(probable) or they have changed the connector.  I ended up having
to destroy the connector, put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and 
then plug them into the SB connector in the correct order.  It works great 
this way so this turned out just fine.  It certainly sounded easy based on
other people's experiences but my attempts did not go too well...
