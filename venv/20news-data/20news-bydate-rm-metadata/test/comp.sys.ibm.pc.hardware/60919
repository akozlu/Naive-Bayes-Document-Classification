Hi,

I have the following problem: I have to use a computer for special purposes
that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. No monitor isn't a 
program - but no keyboard.
I can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup (in fact, there is no setup).
I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply
using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor.
Pity, pity... I lost contact to the person before getting more detail.
So does anyone of you experts can help?

Thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-)

Thomas
