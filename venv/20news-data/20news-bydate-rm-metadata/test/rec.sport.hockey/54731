As long as a player is under contract to an organization, he is obligated to
play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission
to play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and
Andersson to report to Binghampton. 

It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger 
organization, however. Is having Binghampton win the Calder Cup really more
important to them than keeping their players happy?
