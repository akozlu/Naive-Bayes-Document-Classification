  Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs.  I'm here in a
small town in southern Illinois at school.  I'm from Canada and I know
that cbc and tsn have games on every night,  all you have to do is go to
a bar with a satellite.  I have watched both games between Mon Que and
toronto and detroit,  not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc.  They
show all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal
all playoffs.  Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao.
