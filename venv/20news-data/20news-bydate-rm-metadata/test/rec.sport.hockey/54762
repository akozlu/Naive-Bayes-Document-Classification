I think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post -
namely, Quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a GM
in St. Louis.  This trade was an absolutely stupid trade for St. Louis,
and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made.  We can give
Quinn credit for being an opportunist here.

How do you figure?  Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year:
They both won their division, they had close to the same number of points,
they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally
escaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by
teams they should have been able to beat, with less talent.  (Specifically,
if I remember correctly, third place teams).  How does this make Vancouver
more improved?  Further, if I'm not mistaken, the Wings had more points than
Vancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).
