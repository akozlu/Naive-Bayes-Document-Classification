Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  When
I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don't care if he's
in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball!
(Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear
the slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. 
I *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does
too.  I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really
swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people
out of the way.  He's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)
