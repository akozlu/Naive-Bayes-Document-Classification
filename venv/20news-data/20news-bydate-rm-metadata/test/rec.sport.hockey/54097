Hindsight's 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year.


I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough.  Gund's offer
was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November
lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the
playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his
immediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a
prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that).
However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to
Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund
panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago
would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the
first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in
Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan
all look like geniuses.

A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston
(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you
shiver doesn't it. :-)

Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.


Are you serious?
	- Let Ferierra go,
	- fire Kingston (these last two basically mean that
		Sharks are starting over again in terms of the
		timetable to capture the Cup. As I've stated
		frequently: 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM
		from inception through Cup season)

	- broadcast more home games than away games
	- broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games
	- jack up my ticket prices from $27 to $38 in two years (not that I'm
		going to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats. I'll probably next to the
		virtual 107 folks)

	- not tell me my priority #
	- not let me sell my priority #
	- in order for me to get the free jacket, force me to order my tickets
		for next season before I get to select my section

	- not let me park at the new arena after paying for their
		privileged parking lot (which was sometimes full when
		I got there) for 2 straight years.

I've been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of
'90 when the team was announced.  and I'm not getting that loyalty
returned. Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison. And
Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all.


I know one isn't suppose to make negative comments on signatures, but
what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the "Stay in Edmonton"
part? I'd never wish the Kings to leave metro-LA; it's too much fun
watching the Shark's beat them.
