Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players....
you sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their
teams in the regular season.....just too much intensity during the regular 
season.  I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read
this item.....gee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost 
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs.  Kind of makes you wonder.......

Bottom line....man it is great to be smoking the WartHawks!!!!!
Agreed Jim.....this has been damn sweet, so far.  About the only thing
that comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fans....Detroit
has completely kicked their asses so far.  But, I will stick with the
Blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far.
