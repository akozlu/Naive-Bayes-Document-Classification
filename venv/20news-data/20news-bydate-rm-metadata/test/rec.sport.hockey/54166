Not only have I not heard of the Western Business School, or the University
of Western Ontario, I've never even wondered if there WAS a western
Ontario.  And judging by the quality of the posts coming from there, I'm
still not sure that the place exists.

Perhaps I should be impressed, though, since it appears that grade school
children in that area have access to the Internet.
