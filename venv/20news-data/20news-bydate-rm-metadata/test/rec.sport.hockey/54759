Don't let this confuse anybody.  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the
Stanley Cup (or even come that close).  These Stanley Cup championships
go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century.  The Winnipeg
Victorias won one or more of these Cups- the Jets didn't win any of
them.

Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff
series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn
of the century??

Lets face facts.  The Canucks are leading the series 3-1.  The Canucks
dominated the Jets in their season series.  The Canucks did better in
the regular season than Winnipeg.  Who is the better team?  I think
that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg.
