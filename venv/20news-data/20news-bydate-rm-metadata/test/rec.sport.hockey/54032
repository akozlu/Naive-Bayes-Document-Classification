Well, Your Majesty, ;^), couldn't you just picture it?  Cherry starts doing
his first post-game interview with Barrasso;  Tommy gives him that little look
(like somebody crapped on his shoe) and then proceeds to give Don a
tonsilectomy with his Sher-Wood.  Now that you could put on pay-per-view!

Hope you had a good laugh!
