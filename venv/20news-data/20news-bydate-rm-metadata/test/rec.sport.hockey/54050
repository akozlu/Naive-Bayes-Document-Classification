	Don't expect to get top quality, just some toughness.  I don't
	view Makarov as a player who would add toughness.


	Nelson, you're confusing skill and toughness.


	Hey, get off the McGill/Hammond thing.  I'm no fan of either. My
	point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing
	this year.  This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, but
	if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they
	can't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you
	can't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks
	simply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this.
	They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not
	pay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will
	add some toughness to the team will help insure that next
	season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously 
	check our skill players, or to take cheap shots.  It doesn't
	guarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it's something the
	Sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries.
