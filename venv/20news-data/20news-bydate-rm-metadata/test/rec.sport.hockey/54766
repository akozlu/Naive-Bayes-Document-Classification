    Well I was watching Hockey Hotline last night and Stan said that the
station (KBL) had been recieving calls all day concerning this subject. 
And the verdict was that almost exclusively NOBODY wanted that load
mouth, know it all blow hard, former Bruin whiner, Ulf Hating, scum
sucking, Pr*ck of missery in Pittsburgh on a permanent basis.  That's
not exactly what Stan said;  I did do a bit of interpriting.
