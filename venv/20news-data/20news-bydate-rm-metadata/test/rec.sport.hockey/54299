Yeah I think we're used to it by now. (even if some of us do change our
.sigs to root for our second favorite teams :-)


I'll be happy if they win it before I get out of school. (the way it's going
I may be here saying Piled Higher and Deeper before long)


I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement
but......
by far the worst "band  wagon" fans are the PIT fans (at least at the present).
Case in Point -- I know a guy who just came to Hockey Hell(TM) from Pitt U.
Him - "How 'bout the Pens? The're F-ing awesome"
Me - "Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesn't mean alot. Wait until
	they meet Boston and/or Detroit in the Playoffs start."
Him - "When do the Playoffs start?"
Me - "Uhhhh. They started a week ago."

I'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to 
be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
that they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now
and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.
