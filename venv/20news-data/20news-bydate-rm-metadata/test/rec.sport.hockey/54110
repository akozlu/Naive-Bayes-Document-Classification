Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball
Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut
away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if
ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to
let SportsChannel pick up the slack.

Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular
season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.
Support your team; support your game.

Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler
to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would
consider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch
baseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew
bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters
complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and
that you won't consider buying their products because of it.
