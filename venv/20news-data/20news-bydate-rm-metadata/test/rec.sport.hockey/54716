My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the
first period and the Leafs none.  

As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were
calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings.

Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then
calling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot away
from what could have been a great game.
