fans into the game but surely they would rather see Broten taking a pass from
Kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the Rangers up 3 (magic #) goals in
the third period, rather than seeing Kocur take another stupid penalty and the
Rangers giving up another powerplay goal! 

The Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off
Messier and the first line.  Nemchinov is a perfect third line center.

So who goes Beezer or Richter?
