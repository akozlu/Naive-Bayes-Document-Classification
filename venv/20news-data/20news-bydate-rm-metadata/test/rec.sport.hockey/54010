Oh really?  I seem to remember this year's woofers consisting mainly of
yourself and Roger.  Boston fans were relatively quiet.


I guess the concept of a fan who is not cocky is something you couldn't
possible understand, eh?


Nah.  I doubt you really would.  You're just being a PROVOCATIVE SOB
as usual with a large stick up your but.  Of course, I mean that in the
nicest way.  :-)  

And just how much bragging did YOU do, "wobbie," on r.s.b.c after 
UMASS!!! beat your Quakers?

BTW.  Congratulations should go to the Sabres.  They are playing more
diciplined, and with more will to win.  They deserve it.
