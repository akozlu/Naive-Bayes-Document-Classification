It was not just those penalties. Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't
call on the Czechs right before their first goal.


Don't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude, when some people 
throw coins on the ice? Hey, I don't approve the behavior of these guys,
especially not in a WC game, but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi'
in this connection. 
  

Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem (remember the world cup in Italy).
Again: there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop-windows
or fighting with other so-called 'fans', who come to a WC just to see if the
Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers.
Which other sports are you talking about? I don't think soccer is 'every possible
sport'.


How many Germans do you know? Do you think 200 out of 10000 is 'most of them'? 
If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US, what do you
think about the Americans? 'Most of them' like beating blacks?
