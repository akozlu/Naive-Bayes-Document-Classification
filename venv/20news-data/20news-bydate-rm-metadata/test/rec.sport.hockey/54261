  What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised.
  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the
  game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be
  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first
  round. 

  Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other
  game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some 
  exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract
  then they better put some brains in ESPN people.
