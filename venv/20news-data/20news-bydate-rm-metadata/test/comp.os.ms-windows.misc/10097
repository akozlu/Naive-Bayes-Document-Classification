Please do not do this!

I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I
subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a
huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for
the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K
modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. 
Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. 
Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I
didn't want in the first place.

If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other
ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like
ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell
people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like
alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives
rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.
