While I do not think he is lying, I also feel hesitant to take anybody "on their
word" unless they can attribute a source for thier claims. With all the FUD 
and misinformations and misconceptions and outright lies flying around the 
advocacy newsgroups, I do not trust any unsubstantiated rumor or claim 
- especially from any employees of IBM's OR MicroSoft, or anyone who seems to
have a vested interest.
