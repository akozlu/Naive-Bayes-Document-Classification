You don't, and never had to.  That's what enhanced shells are for.  Remember 
4DOS and NDOS?  I mean, come on, you can't expect DOS to cover everything 
from R1.0.  Microsoft has other projects to work on.


I don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  On the other hand, it 
IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
top of DOS.  I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC.  With 
XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna 
need a fast processor.

Except for the people who use DOS programs, which means about 75% or more of 
the business world.
