Speaking of that.....
My comp has "emmexclude=$e000-$efff" or something of that nature in the
system.ini file.  Or some system file for *windows*.

I was just wondering if having that line in a *windows* startup file is
better, as it will give some more memory on dos apps., but disable it
when you run windows?

(Actually, I *do* think that that line is also in the system.1 file)

peace,
