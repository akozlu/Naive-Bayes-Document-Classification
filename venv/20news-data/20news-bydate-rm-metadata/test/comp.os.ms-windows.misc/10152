From article <ardie.313.736188058@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu>, by ardie@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu (Ardie Mack):

EMM386 is NOT reqired to load the DOS kernal high (or else you couldn't
do it on a 286).  In a mail message I recommended that he remove it
since he only runs ProcomPlus frequently in DOS, and I suspect
EMM386 will slow down windows.
