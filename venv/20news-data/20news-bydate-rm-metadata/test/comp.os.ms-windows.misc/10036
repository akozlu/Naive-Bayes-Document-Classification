Yep, you can use any type of UNIX, or maybe VMS, or buy a MAC or something...
  If you want longer filenames for your documents, I heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files. Those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs open/save dialogs though... Maybe someone knows more about
this wordprocessor than I do?
