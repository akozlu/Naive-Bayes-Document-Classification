While working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources,
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug
kernel. Once you have all the SDK stuff installed, (this also comes with
VC++), you run 'n2d' which does a 'normal-to-debug' swap. The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower, but you then execute the command
DBWIN, and let it report to you what is going on. You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to, and possibly about other
peoples Apps (is that OPA?..I'm sorry). 

If this doesn't make sense, repost, or e-mail me
