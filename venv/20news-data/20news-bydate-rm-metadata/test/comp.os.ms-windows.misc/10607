While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations.  If you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it's probably
time take a good look at your program's design.


In what way is 8192 a 'small' number?  It seems to me that you'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles, unless, of course, you're abusing GlobalAlloc.


And _please_ don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems.  All systems have
limits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So
far, you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.
