It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it.
Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that, or...


When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product, I figured it wasn't
from there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.
And I was told it was from a survey of registered users.  And I 
posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came 
from.


Hmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where
they came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is 
"fear, uncertainty & doubt".)


????  I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't 
pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other
OSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary
features.  I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in
comp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a 
new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded 
during release, unless the sales are a total bomb).


I ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really*
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?

I just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
cutter. We don't all think alike.  Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some "inside"
info on MSDOS - doesn't mean that everyone else does :)
