[stuff deleted about Microsoft]
You must of read too many OS/2 advertisements.  "Crash Protection" is such
a marketing gimick, it isn't funny..  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my 
new machine I've only had it crash ONCE, and I don't have a "run of the mill"
configuration.

Microsoft is not a leader in innovation, but they certainly know how to 
build a better mousetrap.  Now, what's wrong with that??
