Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did:
I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same
as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the 
DOS "backup" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the 
"system" diskette, and use DOS "restore" to read in that much, then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your
case), overwriting what I've just restored.  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization
on the "real" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.


Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a "system" floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one "go".
