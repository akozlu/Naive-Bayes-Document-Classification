It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets
that ship with Win31 seem to have this problem (I've seen it in
Solitaire, for example).  


None that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the
resources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of
Windows. 


If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them
don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it.


No.  This is a problem with the applications, usually.


There are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I
understand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so
there's no way to avoid this entirely.



There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on
the resource pool.
