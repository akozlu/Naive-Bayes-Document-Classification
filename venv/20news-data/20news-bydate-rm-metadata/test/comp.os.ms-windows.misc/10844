I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have
strayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split
between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But
there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users
here.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter
which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there
is no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been 
inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity
in a DOS program to selectively transport the files.

The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is 
in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite
clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.
