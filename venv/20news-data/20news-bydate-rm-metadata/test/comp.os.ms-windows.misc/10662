I had posted that it came from a survey of registered users, I 
double-checked with a friendly neighborhood marketing type and
found there were actually two surveys. One of randomly selected
resellers, one of randomly selected users from the 6 upgrade 
registered user database. Both surveys showed a 93% positive
rating.
