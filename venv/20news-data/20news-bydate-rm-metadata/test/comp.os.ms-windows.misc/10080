Yes Russ, there is. 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version.

Last I looked QuinZip could be found on the Monash University (Australia)
mirror site of Cica, so I'd assume it's still on Cica itself
and other mirrors.

Have a look in the /util(s?) directory for a file called
qzip21.zip.
