	If JD Power and Associates did the survey, I would like an 
	anonymous ftp site to pick it up at.  Only a sucker believes
	an MS released survey results about an MS product.  Ok--assume
	that the results of the survey, whatever they are, are 100%
	honest.  If the results indicated extreme dissatisfaction with
	the product, is MS going to tell us to stop buying MS-DOS 6.0
	because it sux? :-)  Sure....


	Well, these "statistics" are to shut people up and add some
	microscopic weight to MS' arguments.  As I just said, you have
	seen what automakers do.  Who is going to believe Chrysler if
	they tell us, "In a 'random' Chrysler-conducted survey..."
	My theory about certain people is that they are convinced that
	if a point is maintained long enough, it is true.  After all,
	what is the focus of this company?  Information.  Money and
	information.  Technology is, for some, an expedient toward
	these ends.  Why did Bill Gates drop out of college?  
	Was it because he couldn't afford it at the time?  Was it
	because (as the WSJ says) he couldn't wait to use what he
	knew to go out and make money?  Bill Gate's answer to this
	question would be highly interesting.  I await it.
	I can't stomach Bill declaring himself a visionary and
	using every available opportunity to build up the cult
	around himself and then having MS sell DOS and Windoze
	as their main stays.
