PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product.  It can handle TIFF, GIF,
BMP, PCX, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between
them.  There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations (I'd try
ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  Log in as ftp, use your username as a password,
and look for a program called PSP101.exe or something like that.  I have
the registered version, and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it.

Once again, FANTASTIC software.  Up to 24 bits, huge images, everything.
