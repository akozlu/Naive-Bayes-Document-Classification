Damn straight! As far as I've heard, unless the owner is _very_
hard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere
mortals could afford.


I think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular
question is moot (see the price figures below).


I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40
registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made 
(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65),
and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a
GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of ;-).

I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although
I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, 
and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They
also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was
rear-engine, rear-drive, with the "bundle of snakes" exhaust
headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I
can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby
Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.
