I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is

There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of
engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired
of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year
old BMW is still as sweet as it was new.

But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow.
I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I
still try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through
blizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design
flaw in the BMW.
