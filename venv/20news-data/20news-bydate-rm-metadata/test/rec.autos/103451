My suggestion look at your current insurance card, there will be a name 
accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by.
Call information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the 
Houston area, call the insurance company.

Your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want,
do you want to carry comp and collision (probably not on an 82),
what your driving record is.  You mentioned none of these things in your
posting so how can anyone give you accurate information.

Like I said, pick up the phone and make a few calls, it won't kill you.
