I hadn't heard of the Valentine-1 before. Car&Driver and other auto
magazines
recommend BEL detectors.  I was considering their latest - the 966STi -
which picks up Super Wideband Ka and Laser as well.  It also avoids 
radar detector detectors (although I really don't care about this since I
doubt I'll be driving in Virginia anytime soon - or have any other states
also made detectors iilegal?)

How does the Valentine-1 compare with the BEL products?
