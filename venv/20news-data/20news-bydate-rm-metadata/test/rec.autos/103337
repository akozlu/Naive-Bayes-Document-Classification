This must vary from state to state, because our old company Kemper wanted
to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket.
Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit.  Well i called Geico, and they
insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying
Kemper.

Generally i hate the whole insurance game. I realize that it is necessary
but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense.

One good thing about Geico is that everything can be handled over
the phone.

            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
            that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!
