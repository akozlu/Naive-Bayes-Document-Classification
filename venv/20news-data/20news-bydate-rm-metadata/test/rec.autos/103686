Or the price tag of the RX7 vs. a Mustang? Part of the definition of
a Mustang is that it should be affordable by the masses. Of course
Ford knows youre argument, THEY OWN A BIG PIECE OF MAZDA! Take a good
look at a Mach III, now an RX7, hhhmmmmm...


That is a tragedy, but I don't think new Camaros or the new Mustangs will.
