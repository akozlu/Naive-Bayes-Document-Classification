I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement. 
I see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been
releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers?
Where did you learn logic?

As for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS
seats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets
and that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.
