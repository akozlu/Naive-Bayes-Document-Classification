The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 4.0L straight 6 which only has about 150hp 
and 220lb-ft of torque.  Plenty off-highway, marginal on the highway.
The 93 has a much improved 4.2L straight 6 with >200hp and 275ft-lb torque.


If you take them on rough trails, you'll see the difference.  The Cruiser
is an order of magnitude better in off-highway ability.
