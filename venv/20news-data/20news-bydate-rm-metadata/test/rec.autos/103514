 Stay away from GEICO.

 A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free
 laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit
 enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket
 your premium will increase dramatically based on how much "over the
 limit" you were.  If I remember correctly, at "more than 20 over",
 you'll get something like a 65% increase. 

 If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped
 immediately. 

 One accident claim and you will be dropped.
 After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made
 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped 
 immediately.  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with
 no complaints.

 I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints.
