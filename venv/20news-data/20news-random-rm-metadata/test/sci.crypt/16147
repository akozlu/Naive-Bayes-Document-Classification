Er, people are going to make personal attacks on Prof. Denning whether she
posts here or not.  That much should be obvious from looking at the traffic
over the last few weeks.  Therefore I conclude that the existence of personal
attacks is irrelevant to any decision concerning whether to post.

I suspect that Prof. Denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for
not posting, and that the real reason for the silence is that Clipper is not
the sort of proposal any self-respecting cryptographer can support via
reasoned argument.
