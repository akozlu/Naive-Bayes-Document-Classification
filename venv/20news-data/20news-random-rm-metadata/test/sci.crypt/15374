The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the
result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either
way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn't
clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must
be provided by other system components.
