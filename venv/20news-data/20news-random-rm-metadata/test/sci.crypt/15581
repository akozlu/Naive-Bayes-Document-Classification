more secure. I have nothing to conceal from the government, but I would like
to be sure that any Russian, Japanese, French, or other competitors for my

I believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities.
The President and many other senior government officials have made it very
clear that they share these motivations. Thus I'd trust them on the
"coincidence of interests" argument as well as on a basic trust in their
professionalism and a high confidence in their skills.
