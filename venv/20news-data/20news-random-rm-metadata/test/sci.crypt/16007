There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  For
example, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs
NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian
Federal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes
a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including
concerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically
charged with running the National Computer Security Center,  -- to
quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at
the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private
sector use.''
