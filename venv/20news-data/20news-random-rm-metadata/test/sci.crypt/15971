I tried this code yesterday.  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over
300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech.  This means that it
needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable
in even a half-duplex mode.

I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application.  It produces
great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads.  We want
something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's
without DSP cards.  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be
a better starting point.
