I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around.  Clinton didn't
just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices; the NSA has to have
been working on it for years.  While it's possible that Denning (and
other prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a
system, it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved.
If this guess is wrong, I apologize.
