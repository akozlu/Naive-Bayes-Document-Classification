says in both sci.crypt FAQs, there's no way we are going to achieve the
same level of comfort with Clipper that we finally have with DES if we
can't actually get our hands on the bits and watch them flow around.  Even
the best experts aren't going to think of everything: look how long it
took Biham and Shamir to get a handle on just how good DES is... and for
all we know there's still more to learn.
