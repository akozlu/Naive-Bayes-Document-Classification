I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
the algorithm through to hardware.  While I doubt the NSA would pull
any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the
chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious
opportunity to introduce additional holes.
