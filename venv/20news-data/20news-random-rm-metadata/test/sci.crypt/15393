I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but
it is not sold by that name. Go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. Quickturn)
containing a bunch of FPGAs, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each
to be a DES search engine. Lets say 500 chips, running at 10Mhz = 5G tests/sec.
Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long?
Buy a bigger machine.
