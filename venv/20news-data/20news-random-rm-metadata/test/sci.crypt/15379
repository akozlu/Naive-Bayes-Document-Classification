This isn't true.  Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe
methods, from cordless phones to cellular phones to plain old copper
wire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and
execute their crimes.

It is amazing how stupid they are, which is why the FBI was so keen on
the digital telphony law, and its successor the clipper chip.  They're
hoping here that most crooks will remain stupid, feel safe using clipper
chip phones and get caught.
