Big deal. If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a
legitimate wiretap order, you just listen in on the line for 10
minutes, get the serial number, and then take the order and go to the
escrow agencies. If you notice the criminal is now using a different
phone instrument, take your still-valid wiretap order to the escrow
agency with the new serial number. (This provides opportunities for
abuse by law enforcement, but thats not what we are discussing right
now.) I oppose Clipper, but the mechanics here are simple and easy to
understand. The whole rest of your article is based on a large series
of false premises, all predicated on the notion that this simple act
is somehow impossible.

I feel free to presume to tell you that you do not seem to understand
the mechanics of the proposal. Arguing that terrorists will be killing
people for their clipper phones is silly because its pointless. Lets
be alarmist about what really would show up as a problem, shall we?
