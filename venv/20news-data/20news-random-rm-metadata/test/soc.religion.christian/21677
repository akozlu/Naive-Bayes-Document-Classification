But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we
all have defective appetites due to original sin.  Not just
homosexuals, but everybody.  Thus we are not entitled to indulge in
whatever behavior our bodies want us to.

I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual
_behavior_ (which is wrong) and homosexual _orientation_ (which is not
a sin, merely a misfortune).
