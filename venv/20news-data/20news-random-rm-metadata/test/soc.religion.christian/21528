It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it. If
people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are
miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of
the Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply
making noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are
not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects.

The more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply
uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one
that should be used by those who make use of this practice.

I agree with the point that "Charismatic" practices like this
can lead to forms of worship which are more about the
worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of the
things Jesus warned us about.
