I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a 
personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have 
with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for
others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just 
Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems
within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters
of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by
objective means.  

Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these 
matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this
that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus 
anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing
the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the
honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.
Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is
universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud
notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that
leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)
