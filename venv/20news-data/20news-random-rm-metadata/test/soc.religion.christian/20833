I won't even recommend books from my congregation.  What you ask sounds
attractive but it is dangerous.  As a new Christian you don't want to be
contaminated with other people's interpretation.  Steep your self in
scripture, and discuss with other christians.  Read if your must but
remember that what other people write is their interpretation.  God has
promised to give you light, so ask for it.



Don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  Just remember to
always compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did.
