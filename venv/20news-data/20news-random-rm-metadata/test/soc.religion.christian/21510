Well, Michael,  I don't know if clh has left them in the faq  (Maybe you should
post the "how to get there map again), but I posted two or three lengthy
exegetical paper on these verses.  They looked at the OT, NT and
intertestimental usages of terms in reference.  I would suggest you read those
before you talk about a "need" in exegetical studies.  If those aren't enough,
I could also provide "The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai".  Dr James
DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '92.  To read
any of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
for honest exegesis.

Again, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me
a line and I will enclose them to you.
