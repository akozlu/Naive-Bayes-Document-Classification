It is just as Christ said about his return:

"Some will say, 'He is in the desert.' or some will say, 'He is in the
wilderness.'  But do not believe them.  For as lightning flashes east to
west so shall the coming of the Son of Man be."  
                                         { My paraphrase - I think the
verse is
                                           somewhere in John }
