Who is Ram Das?

According to his brochures, he is a.k.a. Richard Alpert, PhD, and is
somehow associated with the:

  Seva Foundation
  8 N. San Pedro Road
  San Rafael, CA  94903

and the:
  Hanuman Foundation 
  524 San Anselmo Ave #203
  San Anselmo, CA  94960

He speaks publically on such topics as "Consciousness & Current
Events," and has written some books and recorded some tapes on 
similar subjects.  

Why do I care?  My wife wants to go to one of his lectures.  When
I asked why, she said Ram Das was "the greatest spiritual leader
of our time!"

Several years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult, and
we went through 9 months of hell that almost ended our marriage 
before she quit.  Let's just say I'm concerned about this Ram Das
and her interest, especially so with the recent religious cult
events from Texas.  I need information - solid and real - so I 
know what I'm dealing with.

If you have any information about Ram Das or the organizations 
shown above, I would be very interested in your correspondence.
