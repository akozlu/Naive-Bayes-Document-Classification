Please excuse the interruption.
 
I am seeking pro-life activists to fill out a 13-page questionnaire
on attitutes, opinions, and activities.  If you would be willing
to participate in this research, please email me privately at
KSTE@PURCCVM.BITNET.  All replies and questionnaires will be
made anonymous prior to printout and will be kept confidential.
 
Thank you very much for your help.
