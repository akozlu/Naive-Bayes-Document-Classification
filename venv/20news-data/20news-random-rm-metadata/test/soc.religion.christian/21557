   You may not think that it is fair, but how many sins do you know of
that affect only the sinner?  Is it fair for us even to be able to get
into Heaven?  Do we have a _right_ to Heaven, even if we were to lead
sinless lives?  Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, "If _I_ were
God, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do
things that way."

	Isaiah 55:8-9:

	"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
	ways, saith the LORD.  For as the heavens are higher than the
	earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
	than your thoughts."

   Original Sin is biblical:

	Romans 5:12-14:

	"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
	by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
	sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
	imputed when there is no law.  Nevertheless death reigned from
	Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the
	similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him
	that was to come."

	1 Corinthians 15:22:

	"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
	alive."
