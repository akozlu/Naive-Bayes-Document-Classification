I have a simple test. I take several people who can speak
only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english).
Then I let the "gifted one" start "speaking in toungues".
The audience should understand the "gifted one" clearly
in their native language. However, the "gifted one" can
only hear himself speaking in his own language.

Works everytime. 8-)
Perhaps I would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were
glorifying God rather than themselves. Then perhaps we'd
witness a real miracle.
