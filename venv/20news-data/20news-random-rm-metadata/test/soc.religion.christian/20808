As a muslim (spelled sometimes as Moslem) I must say that Muslims strong
ly believe in Jesus.  Refered in islamic text as eesau(as)

         Jesus ==>  J - esu  - s    ===> esu (pronounced eee-saw)

Yah we knew him well.  Ideally, this war should not even be.  And even in
a time of war, our goal is peace.  We should try to refrain from viloating
the peace of others as then if we do violate, we will not have peace in
ourselves.  I don't like this war eaither,  It is a conflict of territory.
Croats, Muslims, and Serbs lived together before in peace.  The rallying
point is 'race'.  And Im sure that there is a General out there who wouldn't
mind being a president.
