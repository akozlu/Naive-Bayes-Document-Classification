First, off I'd say that the impact if right before your eyes! 8-) That we are
even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. Further, the early
church bears testimony to the impact.


Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both
the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't 
need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to 
make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a 
man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was
buried begs the question.

Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on
this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a 
deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm
not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth, 
but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about
dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to
be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the 
body seems rather lightweight to me.

As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over 
the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is
an argument that can be discounted.

That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?
