Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath.
He was never ever a musician in the band.  He was in St. Louis several
months back.  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent
really turned me off.  It was addressed to all "Homosexuals, prostitutes,
drug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers..." or something like that.

Well, if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I
would have felt a little pre-judged.  As a Orthodox Christian, and
a "headbanger" I was slightly insulted at being lumped together with
drug addicts and alcoholics.  Oh yes, I suppose since I drink a good
German beer now and then that makes me an alcoholic.  NOT!
