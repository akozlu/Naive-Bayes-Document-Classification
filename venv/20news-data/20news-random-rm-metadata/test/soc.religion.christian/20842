J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the "Plymouth Brethren" and an
early supporter of dispensationalism.  F.F. Bruce highly approved
of his translation.  He also translated the Bible into several other
languages.


This was from the same fellow who did Young's Concordance, which was
a standard reference work, similar to Strong's concordance.


I believe that these just follow standard reference works.


Some are by Larry Pierce ("Brethren"), some are by Baptists, and I
think that Thompson (of chain reference fame) was Presbyterian)


Another standard reference work that has been around for decades.
A new version was just released and is available through Christian
Book Distributers.


C.I. Scofield was the creator of the Scofield Reference Bible.  For many
people (but not me), this is THE STUDY BIBLE.  The notes are strongly
dispensational.


These are probably the most accurate Strong's numbers available.
