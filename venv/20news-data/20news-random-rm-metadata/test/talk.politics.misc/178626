The original poster never said they were afraid of King because he was
black.  In fact the officers were afraid of King because of WHAT HE DID,
not because OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN.  It is you, Mr. Frank that read the
phrase "large black man" and cried racism in a typical knee-jerk fashion.
When you (and others, I suspect) can get past this problem maybe the real
problems in this issue can be discussed.
