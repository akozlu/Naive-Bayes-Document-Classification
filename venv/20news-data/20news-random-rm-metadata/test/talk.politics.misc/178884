As far as a member of the Armed Forces is concerned, the
President is whatever the h*ll he wants to be. All of them
recently have rather insisted on being treated as something
other than a *mere* civilian.


So if Hilary were asleep at the time......


I like living in a country where the head of state is not
a military officer too. But this point about not using the
military as the first choice for solving domestic problems....

Didn't they go after these Branch Davidians with a *tank*,
after all?
