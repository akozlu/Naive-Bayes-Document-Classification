Garrett, you are a really pathetic liar.

Some of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.

I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole,
rigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers
of his office for personal gain.

You can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these
events occurred.
