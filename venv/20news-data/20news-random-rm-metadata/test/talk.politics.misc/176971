Cite one of these conflicting statutes.  You keep making
these assertions, but you haven't supported any of them yet.
I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition
Larry posted.

Why did you delete the code that Larry posted?

Also, the Model Penal Code made perfect sense to me.  Were you,
perhaps, confused by it?

Also, I am still looking for your definition.  The one you used
clearly indicates that a fetus is not a human being.


Circular arguments are usually very consistent.



Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit
your needs.  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based
on "action versus inaction."  Not much of a principle.  Suddenly
you recognize that the claim on bodily resources is dependent
on circumstances other than this principle of life.  That's
a very conevnient principle you have there, Matt.
