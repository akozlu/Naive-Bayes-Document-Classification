Clayton, are you really an idiot, or do you just play one on USENET?

You claimed you had postings from a dozen (i.e. 12) soc.motss posters that
"supported child molestation". (Point aside that they were really defending
abolishing or modifying the age of consent laws, or the right to be ATTRACTED
but don't act upon desires for children).

so 12 out of thousands is an "overwhelming majority".

You never cease to amaze me.

And you still haven't told me why my relationship with my partner is immoral.
