Why all the quote marks, Roy?  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context, 
or that they have been appropriated Newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above,
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that "child abuse",
"forced" sexual activity, and "damage" caused by this is non-existant or
greatly overblown.

"Positive experiences", indeed!
