Which number is that?  Zero?

Please present "a number" of authoritative works which "suggest"
that "homosexuality is a form of mental disorder, caused by
childhood sexual abuse."

Don't present your own biased conclusions, based on a collage
of tidbits you've extracted from a few hours' research, as the
conclusions of people who study mental disease and sexual abuse
professionally.
