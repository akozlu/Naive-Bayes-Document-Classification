You know, you have a point here, but don't stop with African Americans...
When I was in high school in the early 1980s, on various occasions I had
knives pulled on me, had friends who were stabbed, and I was beaten up
repeatedly by those that couldn't accept me as different.  And don't
let the teachers off the hook either.  On many many occasions, there
were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their
wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they
would just watch quietly...  All of this was in a nice white middle
class high school.  In fact, we were so nice and white that we made
sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom
with his white girlfriend...  This isn't a race thing, it's the
way public schools seem to be run...

I'd hate to be in high school right now...  At least I didn't have
to deal with guns, just the roving psycho-drug-dorks and the jocks-
without-a-future-but-with-plenty-of-testosterone...

I'd separate everyone who wants to learn from these assholes...  But hey,
the valuelessness of learning and glorification of jocks is an American
tradition, you think anything is going to change?  If you have kids,
take 'em out of the public school system and educate them yourself...
That's what I'll do if I ever have them...  I wouldn't wish what I went
through upon any kid...  Maybe on some of their parents though...
