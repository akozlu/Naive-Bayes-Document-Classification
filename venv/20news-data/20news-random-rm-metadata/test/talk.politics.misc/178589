Well, some form of guaranteed health care isn't a bad idea, but,
yah, I'm a bit worried of a gubnint-run HMO myself.  I'd much
rather have something like Canada has [and I'll *belt* anyone
who tells me to move to Canada :)], but since people will yell
and scream "NO!!! NOT ONE LIKE CANADA HAS!!!", we're
probably all screwed.



Impressive.

Let the "GREAT CHUCKMEISTER" make a couple predictions, if you
will:

1.  The sun will rise tomorrow.
2.  Rush will bash Clinton on his next show.
3.  I will turn out to be Clinton's love child.

Chances are, I'll get at least one of those right, if I'm lucky.
I may even get two.



Can't argue with you there.  Once the gubnint has its hands in yer
pocket, they just can't help but feel around a bit....




Oh, no SH**?!  You mean, our weakened economy will collapse in
the face of all this gubnint tax-and-spending, and everyone will
be in the handout line?  You're a GENIUS!!




Deficit reduction.  Spending cuts via fee increases?



No, any first-year PoliSci major will tell you that the Prez
*never* raises taxes.  Congress does it.

All those who voted the Clinton ticket get to wear this *new*
label.....

Hook, line, and sinker!  *chuckle*
