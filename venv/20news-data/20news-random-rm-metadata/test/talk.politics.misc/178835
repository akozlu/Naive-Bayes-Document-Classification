 This is a reply to an article by Ed Ipser which also appeared in
 alt.politics.usa.misc and alt.politics.libertarian, but no longer belongs)


I hate to defend Ed (the article was very poorly written) but here goes:


Italy's per-capita debt is much higher than USA's.



This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the
problem-- thus the French election and Italian pulizia.


Regarding the post-pulizia Italy:

Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style
first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would
encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.

(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)

Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians
are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and
Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party
system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

It's about time.
