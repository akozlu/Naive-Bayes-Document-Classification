I wouldn't worry too much about it, though.  We are starting to find
out how politically impotent homosexuals really are.  The Colorado
boycott has fizzled, Slick Willie was effectively prevented from
implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his
_OWN_ party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their
claims of large numbers, and coming this Saturday they are going to
wind up with _TREMENDOUS_ egg on their face when, I submit, no more
than perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in Washington while they are
promising crowds in the millions.  And most of the ones who will be
there will look like ACT-UP and Queer Nation, not the guy working in
the next cubicle.  As if that's really going to play in middle
America.

Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
where they belong.
