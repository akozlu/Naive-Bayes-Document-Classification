     You're right, I bailed out in Diff Eq.  Nevertheless, I would 
     suggest to YOU that there is a difference between a "proposed BILL,
     stalled in Congress" and a "executive order, crammed down OUR 
     THROATS".   Do you disagree?



        Went to the Post Office on Friday, got my passport apps in.
