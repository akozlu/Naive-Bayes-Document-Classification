Maybe because the claims deserve refute?  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but 
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow.

What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of 
research?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not
prove anything.


Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
effect people differently.  


Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that 
function just fine in society.  


Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.

NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
and that makes them stronger.  


the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as
a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

In general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this.  This has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,
and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _ANYBODY_ by
word of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly.  

gotta run to class..
