Not that I think anyone cares, but this pattern (using other examples
of course) was discussed 2,000 years ago by Aristotle in
_Nicomachean_Ethics_.   Note that you can't use this insight to reason
backwards; e.g.:  Since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
the liberals see the media as conservative, the media are fair!  (though
I've seen this "reasoning" implied)
