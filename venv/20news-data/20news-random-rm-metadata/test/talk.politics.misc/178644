Is this an arguement against or for?  Or simply a statement of agreeance/
disagreeance.  The fact that there are more homosexuals in prison does not
mean that homosexuals are immoral and more liable to commit crime.  And one
must remember that prison is not necessarily a reflection of the type of
people who are criminals.  What are the statistics for unsolved crime?
