I was not discussing "universal" definitions in this post, Mark. Please
refrain from dragging in irrelevancies.

Do you agree with my statement above about physicians being unqualified if
they can't determine viability?


And that's good enough for the law, Mark. So why do you keep whining that
viability "isn't defined"? What purpose does your whining serve?
