       Let's try that again:  Why was the BATF concerned about surprise
when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door?  The
BATF appears to be inconsistant in their own description of events.

       And in any case, how does one mount an ambush if one isn't
"on alert?"


       So, were the BATF fired on before or after they left the trailers
to knock on the door to serve the warrant?  Every description I've
heard indicates the BATF did not hang around in the trailers once
they decided to open them up.

       For that matter, if they expect peaceful citizens, why come in live-
stock trailers to being with?


       Ok, just to make sure we've got this straight:  You consider
armed troops in disguised vehicles and multiple helicopters to be
used to serve search warrants on peaceful citizens.  (And just so
we don't have one of those entertaining shifts, *you* described them
as the BATF expecting them to be, peaceful.)


       I don't see how past abuses excuse present ones.  Hell, you're
not even discussing the same government.
