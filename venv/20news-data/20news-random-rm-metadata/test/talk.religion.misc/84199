	You can tell, folks, when the man has run out of reason:
	attack the man's beliefs (in legal terminology, argument
	ad hominem:  attack the man, not what he did that has yet to
	be proven illegal)>



	WRONGo.  Remember the fire movie a couple of years ago?
	"Backdraft"?  The scene in the factory with propane gas
	coming out of pipes and gasoline all over the floor,
	with a 750 degree flame front overhead?

		Note that it did not flash all at once?

	Fires ignite and burn unpredictably.
	Gases (like tear gas) mix and distribute unevenly.
		And flash unevenly.

	You are not a fire analyst.  You cannnot tell.
		(NB:  Neither am I.  And I cannot tell
		Nor is the FBI spokesman
		Nor is Reno
		Maybe we all should shut up and get a
			forensics analysis first.


	Yes,. there was a flash:  in one room, just pumped full of it.,
