Sorry, but it doesn't matter what _you_ think, I am a Christian, who happens to
belong to the LDS Church.  [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints].

I don't usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that there
are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts
of Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico,
where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  I'm willing
to admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and
(try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of 
the bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether
or not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefs
that must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other large
bodies of believers?  

I know, this is a waste of everyone's time, this has probably been discussed N times,
etc.  I guess I'm more sensitive to this 'demonization' after what went on in Texas.
