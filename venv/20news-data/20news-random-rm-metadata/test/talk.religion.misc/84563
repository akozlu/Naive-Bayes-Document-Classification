  i guess i ought not conclude from this, then, that since you didn't ask to
be created, you don't care if you go to hell.  :)



  i don't consider myself an unthinking sheep.  the bible says god created
us to be in communion and obedience to him.  the first and only rule was
to not eat of a certain tree, or else the punishment is distance from him
and physical death.  god's intention in creating us is to have a relationship
with us.  the bible documents god's attempts to have that relationship
culminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so
that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again: the purpose
of creation.
