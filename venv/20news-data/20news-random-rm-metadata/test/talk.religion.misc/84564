  just a point, i suppose, if open mind means believing anything can be true
or we can't for sure know what is definitely true, i'm happy to not be open
minded.  if, however, open mindedness means being respectful and tolerant
towards other beliefs, respecting the rights and intelligence and wisdom
of people of other beliefs and giving equal time to alternative ideas, i
try my very best to be open minded.  just a thot in passing.... :)


  not being married, i cannot say too much to you, but from my perspective
having mutually exclusive faiths would be a big enough roadblock for me in
considering marrying someone.  making it much bigger than it is?  i suppose
that depends on how serious each of you is in your beliefs.  lukewarm atheists
and christians for whom religion is of nominal importance probly would feel
the issue isn't very big.  i suppose the more important your beliefs are to
each of you, the more important the issue is.
