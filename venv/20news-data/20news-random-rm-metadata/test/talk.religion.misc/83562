I live in Colorado, and have never heard of such a group.  Obviously claims 
that their posters are appearing "all over Colorado" are a tad overdone... 


Hardly.  Saying that homosexuality is a sin is a far cry from 
"Working for a fag-free America".  Saying that I wouldn't want 
a homosexual babysitting for my kids doesnt mean I endorse 
"Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash".  


And now we have homosexual advocates telling us that if we don't teach 
our kids that homosexuality is natural and a perfectly acceptable 
alternative lifestyle, then they will have it done for us.  No, thanks. 


Absolutely.  And the message is always, "go and sin no more".  Not, 
Go and do whatever "feels good". 



This sounds real nice, but struck me as a little odd.  You're 
presenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian, who is sticking
his neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support 
of gays in the church.  But I was under the impression that you
yourself are gay.  That's all well and fine, but presenting yourself 
as sticking out your neck to help "repressed others" seems a bit 
untruthful under the circumstances....
