     Now doesn't this sound a lot like the "colorful (or otherwise) story 
     from antiquity that somehow tries to (or does) explain natural pheno-
     mena"?  I think I hear what you're saying, but I'm not convinced that
     I know what you mean.  The possibility exists that what _looks_ like
     "myth" on the surface may be after all much more than "just" a story.
