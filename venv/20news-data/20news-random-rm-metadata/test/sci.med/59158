Good story, Chuck, but it won't wash.  I have read the NY Acad Sci
one (and have it).  This AM I couldn't find any reference to
"weight rebound".  I'm not saying it isn't there, but since you
cited it, it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there.
There is no index.  I suspect you overstepped your knowledge base,
as usual.
