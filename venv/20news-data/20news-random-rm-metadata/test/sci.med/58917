Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and
ability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.
However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific
research refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought
to start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a little
effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a
healthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you can
verbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are the
studies?

I appoligize if this sounds flamish. I simply would like to see the thread get
back on track.
