I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
be carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.".  I think that
naturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are
pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives
or other "consumption".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an
ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they 
really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.
How in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products
(which probably SHOULD be banned)?
