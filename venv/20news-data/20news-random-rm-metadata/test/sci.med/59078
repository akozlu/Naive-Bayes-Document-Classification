Your doctor is right. It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain
medication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand,
to have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" the 
patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe
an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the
patient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the
problem. Either way, the end results are the same.
