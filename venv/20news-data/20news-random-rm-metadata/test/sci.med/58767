I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?  

It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
legitimate hypotheses.  The point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy, 
daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.
