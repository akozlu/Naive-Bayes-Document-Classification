   I have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called 
   Septra DS.  He said it may cause GI problems and I have a sensitive stomach 
   to begin with.  Anybody ever taken this antibiotic.  Any good?  Suggestions 
   for avoiding an upset stomach?  Other tips?

I've taken Septra.  My daughter has taken it many times for ear
infections.  It works sometimes.  It is a sulfa drug.  About the only
problem I found was that I'm sensitive and developed a rash after nine
days of a ten day course.  No more Septra for me.  My doctor was
remiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash.  I was quite in the
dark and didn't realize that it could be a drug reaction.  No harm
done though.
