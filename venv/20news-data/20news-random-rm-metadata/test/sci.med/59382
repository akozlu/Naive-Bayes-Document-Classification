=True.. but what about showing the missing part of a leaf?  Is this
="corona discharge"?

Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part of
the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity.  Surprise, surprise!
