I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections. I 
get rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the
scrotum and the base of the penis. They're nowhere near as dangerous
for me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime!
Even in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The
best thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and
keep cool down there. Shorts in 60 degree weather, that kind of thing. And
of course some occasional sun.
