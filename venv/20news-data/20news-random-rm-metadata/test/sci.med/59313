[synopsis] Young man with inguianl hernia on one side, repaired, now has
new hernia on other side.  What gives, he asks?  [and he continues...] 

There is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing
chronic straining which has caused the bowel movements.  The classic 
problems that are supposed to be looked for in someone with a hernia are
constipation, chronic cough, colon cancer (and you're not too young for
that) and sitting for long periods of time at the computer, reading news.

Good Luck with your surgery!
