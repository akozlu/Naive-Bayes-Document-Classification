FMGs.
particularly

FMGs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult
situation. Only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of
little or no interest to legislators. Also, the non-citizen may well
be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. There is a
stron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program)
will delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.
