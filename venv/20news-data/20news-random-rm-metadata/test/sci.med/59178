I saw a Lifetime Medical Television show a few months back on travel
medicine.  It briefly mentioned some drugs which when started two or
three days before getting to altitude could assist in acclimitazation.

Unfortunately all that I can recall is that the drug stimulated
breathing at night???  I don't know if that makes sense, it seems
to me that the new drug which stimulates red blood cell production
would be a more logical approach, erythropoiten (sp?).

Alas, I didn't record the program, but wish I had, since I live
at over 7000ft. and my mother gets sick when visiting.

Please let me know if you get more informative responses.
