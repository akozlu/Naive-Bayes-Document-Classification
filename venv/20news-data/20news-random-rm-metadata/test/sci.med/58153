There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in,
I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.
I don't believe there has been any great insight into the
increased incidence in that area. There is a low-level
of endemic infection in that region. Many people with
evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
serious disease.
