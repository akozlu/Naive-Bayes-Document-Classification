As you note, the research is mixed, so there is no consensus on the
role of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis.  There is a role for short
chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches
that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role
for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking 
forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are
doing.  

You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other
fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or
even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  By the way,
the abbreviation EPA is not in general use, so I do not know what 
fatty acid you are speaking about.

And to Brian an U of C ---  There is a physician named Stephen Hanauer
there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You might 
give him a call.  He is interested in new combinations of drugs for 
the treatment of IBD.  If you call please say hello to him from me,
I was looking at U of C for a position, and perhaps still am.  And
be sure to look into joining the CCFA.

Best of Luck.
