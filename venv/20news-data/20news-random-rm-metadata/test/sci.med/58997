This, simply stated, is a result of the bankrupt ethics in
the healthcare and scientific medicine industries.

America is fed up with the massive waste and fraud that is costing
us 15% of our GNP to support these industries, while delivering 
marginal health care to the community.

Unfortunately, the "Clinton Plan", in whatever form it
takes, will probably cost us an even greater sum.  Bleah.
