My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group.
Just Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw
all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's
seizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported that
she did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then
went 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate 
candy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She 
sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  With
corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.  

With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stays
away from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eat
candy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won't
even use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk food
addict!
