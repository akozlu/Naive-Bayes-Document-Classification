The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child
without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor.
The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got
picked up by the child.  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if
the timing was 'right'.
