: I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.
: 
: When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
: the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.
: Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
: event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
: that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.

We had the same problem and on most of our machines it works if we use
Backing Store instead of Save under.
