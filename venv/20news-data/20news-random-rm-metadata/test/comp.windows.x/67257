I have a problem with icon pixmap. My application has to run
   under openwindow and motif. I wrote my program in Motif with pixmap and
   icons. It runs fine under motif/motif window manager and X11R5/mwm. But 
   the icon pixmap does not show up under openwin/olwm and X11R5/olwm.

             Has anybody got into this kind of problem? Need a clue. An 
   example which works in both X11R5/motif and openwindow will be great.
