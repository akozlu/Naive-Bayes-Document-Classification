Hi,

I have an application which draws graphs, bar charts etc. I need to include
print support for these from within my application i.e. a user can print
the graphs from within the applictaion by clicking on a print button. I am 
not sure if I can invoke xwd & xpr from within my application and specify
the window id to get my window dump and then send this file for printing or 
if there are other ways of doing this. I would appreciate any help in this 
regard. Thanx.
