I have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 486/33Mhz
system.



Excuse me, but with a 486/50 256k cache, S3 928 ISA card, 8Mb XS3 (X11R5) running 386bsd  you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt 
that your XP10 series gets. Commerical verions X servers for S3 928 cards
can get 136k xstones. So the performance is there and additionally since
is running unix multiple users can use the system which I have done in
my home setup.

Maintenance is minimal if you can read README files for the X servers and
for 386bsd.
