: I'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with X clients.

: Any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -
: particularly XTM, XRunner, Autotester, and SRI's CAPBAK, SMARTS and EXDIFF.

How about starting where I could find ANY of these.  For the commercial
ones, at least a phone number would be appreciated.
