It's actually a bug in the Solaris 2.1 kernel. We could add a workaround to
xterm. open should never return EINVAL, but it does :-(

I didn't have time to update the R5.SunOS5 patch lately, but non
of the existing problems seem to warrant a new set of patches.


XDM coulda also keep the XDM environment variable. It should have inherited
it from the environment.
