Now available: xvertext 4.0 
--------------

Summary                                  
-------
xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages, but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped.

What's new?
-----------
I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
speeding up redraws.

Where can I get it?
