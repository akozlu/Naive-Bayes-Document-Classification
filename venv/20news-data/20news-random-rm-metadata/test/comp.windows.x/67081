Environment:
	X11R4
	Motif 1.1.4
	Sun IPC 4.1.3

Problem:
	When mouse is moved across screen horizontally, the sprite goes off
	of the edge of the screen and reappears at the *other* edge.
	It appears that the server thinks we are running in multi-screen
	mode; the cursor seems to "wrap" from one side of the screen to
	the other.
	As far as we can tell, we are not running the server in multi-screen
	mode.

Please reply via E-mail.
