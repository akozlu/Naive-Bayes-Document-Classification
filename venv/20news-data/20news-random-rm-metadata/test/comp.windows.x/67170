The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are
fast.


Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.


No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()
BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !
