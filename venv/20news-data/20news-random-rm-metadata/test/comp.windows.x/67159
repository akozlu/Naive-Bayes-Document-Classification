Would if only it were true ...

If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm "InstallWindowColormaps()" crash bug
once and for all, then I could say that I've (almost) unable to crash either
"twm" or "tvtwm", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to
boot.  I mean, this bug has only been reported, oh, a zillion times by now ...

Now *servers*, on the other hand ... (want to crash an OpenWindows 3.0 "xnews"
server at will?  Just do an 'xbiff -xrm "XBiff*shapeWindow: on"'.  Blammo.)
