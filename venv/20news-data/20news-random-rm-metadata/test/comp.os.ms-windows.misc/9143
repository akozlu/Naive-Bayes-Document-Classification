                                              EMX

Note here: the MKS toolkit (for DOS/Windows & OS/2) gives you a good
suite of standard UNIX utilities.  There are other similar systems from
other vendors as well.  The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of
all, EMX is free.  :-)

There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with
Windows, as far as I know.


Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires
DOS.

BTW, two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare ($300
for the personal edition) and LINUX (free).  So I don't agree that "a
good one costs $400-$700."  :-)

And, if you really want to check out the various options available to
you, you should also look into DESQview and DESQview/X.
