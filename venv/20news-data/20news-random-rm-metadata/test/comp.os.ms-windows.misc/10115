Can anyone tell me where to find a standard VESA display driver that will 
support the on-the-motherboard XGA video of a 486 50Mz DX2 IBM Model 95
(8595-0LF)?  I need to use 640 x 480 and higher resolutions under both 
Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS.  Minimum colors 256 at highest resolution, with 64K 
colors needed at 640 x 480.
