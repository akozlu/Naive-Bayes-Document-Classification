I think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are
correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,
you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the
uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with
Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your A,B and D drives.
