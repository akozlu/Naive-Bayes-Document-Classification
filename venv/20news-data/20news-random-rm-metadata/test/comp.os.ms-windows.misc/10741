Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures
of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think
in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.
I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.
