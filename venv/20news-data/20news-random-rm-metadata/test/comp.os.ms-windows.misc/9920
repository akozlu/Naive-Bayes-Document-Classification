For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them
back and expect it to work.  You have to create a new WIN.COM file.  Try
the command (you will have to worry about what directories each file is in
since I don't know your setup):

COPY /B WIN.CNF+VGALOGO.LGO+VGALOGO.RLE WIN.COM

(I grabbed this from _Supercharging Windows_ by Judd Robbins--great book)
This is also how you can put your own logo into the Windows startup screen.
An RLE file is just a specially compressed BMP file.

Hope this helps
