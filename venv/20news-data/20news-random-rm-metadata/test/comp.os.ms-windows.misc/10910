Since I started this twist of this thread...


Actually you fell into the above because you said "I believe"
If you had used the rest of this post in your previous post
I do not think anyone would have agrued with you.



The following three are not the competition for Windows 3.0 (IMHO of course)
System 7  -- Does not currently run on Intel boxes
NeXTSTep  -- Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not 3.x
Unix/X    --   "        "        "    " "      "     "    "     "   "   "


With the exception of OS/2 all of the above will require most users
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that
run under these OS's. And basically money speaks louder than anything
else. You keep saying "More stable multitasking" is what you mean
"Not Multi-finder / GEM / GeoWorks co-operative multi-tasking but
real honest to goodness prioritized pre-emptive multi-tasking"?


Basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for
quite a long time, but are still to blind to know it.


Why pick it up? You stated the reasons behind your opinions. Stated them in 
a very straight-forward, though over protective, manner. And aside from
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor, I think we are in
agreement.

Does Tim Glauert agree? Let's wait and see.
