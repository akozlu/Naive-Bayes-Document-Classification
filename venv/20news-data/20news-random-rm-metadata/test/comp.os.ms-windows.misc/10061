We are researching what support there is on various platforms for applications
to use multi-byte characters (e.g., Japanese Kanji).  We know that Unix
and X Windows can contain support for the i18N standard (depending on level
and platform).  What support for i18N or wide characters exists on the Mac, 
Windows 3.1 and Windows NT?
