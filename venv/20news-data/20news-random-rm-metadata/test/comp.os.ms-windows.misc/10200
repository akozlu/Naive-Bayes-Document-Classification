The May issue of PC/Computing page 246 has a Windows hint and tips for
just this thing.  You have to edit the WIN.INI file and add a couple
of lines.  I tried it and it works.  I actually made my Title bar
and iconized text, and icon text smaller.  On my monitor it works well.
You can select a larger font also.  You edit the WIN.INI file with
a font name in your system directory.  Read the article because I would
not want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your
system problems.
