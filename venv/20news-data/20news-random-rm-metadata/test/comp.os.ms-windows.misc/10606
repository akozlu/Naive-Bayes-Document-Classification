To windows 3.0, yes.


It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was
developing it...)


I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice
before 2.0 was released).


No, I've seen no such data.


hee hee.  good one  ;>  ;>


...and one that I've encountered as well...


Hmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).


I will confess to, at times, attacking the poster.  


Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell" 
readers on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads" 
philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,
members of the BORG.
