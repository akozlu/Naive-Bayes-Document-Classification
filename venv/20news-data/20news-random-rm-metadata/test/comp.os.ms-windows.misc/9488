Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!  My 9600 baud
modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X. I get
about 7 million WinMarks on my 386-25 and it just about keeps up with the
modem speed (using procomm plus for windows, too).  He should get over
10 million on his machine with the same card.  Anything 10+ should yield
acceptable speed...
