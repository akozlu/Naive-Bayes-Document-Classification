WFWG does use NDIS but it cooperates well with the NDIS shim for ODI.
(I've heard that it is as fast as NDIS direct)
                            

The additional TSR load is minimal.  I think I eat another  20K total.
This is worth it to me since it allows me to get to my Windows NT 
box.  Novell hasn't released a decent NT Novell client yet so I share
through my WFWG box.
