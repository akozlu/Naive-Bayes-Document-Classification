Note that the two tables don't talk about the same population.  One is
Fortune 1000 companies favoring the platform as their primary
application platform, the other is sales (to everyone, not just
Fortune 1000).  Fortune 1000 companies don't do a lot of development
with the Mac as their top platform.  I would expect that that would
explain the discrepancy.
