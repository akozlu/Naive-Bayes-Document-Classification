Hey Larry,
        How can you be a comp sci major and never crash a damn computer.
What does your CS dept teach you...or are you just that good of a programmer
that not one of your assembly programs have ever downed your machine.


Why do you bother putting up such stupid posts...or are you that ignorant.
