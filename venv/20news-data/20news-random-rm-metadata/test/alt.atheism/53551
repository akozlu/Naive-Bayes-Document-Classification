: BULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was "smart." The
: rest - that's 93% - was just regular, dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. Have
: you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch
: was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a
: successful interception of a Scud was defined as "the Patriot and Scud
: passed each other in the same area of the sky"?
: 
: And of the 7% that was the "smart" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me
: here - that means 65% of this "smart" arsenal missed.
