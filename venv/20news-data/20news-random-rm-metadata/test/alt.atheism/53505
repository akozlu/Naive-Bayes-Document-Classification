As I understand, that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money
cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed
to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but
is still surviving.


Of the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your
figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by
enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them
around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb
munitions.  

2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number
of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  That figure came
not from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such
stuff in another part of DoD.

3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas
where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very
little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.  


This figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it
is indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between
that figure, and other figures from international organizations?
Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is 
still far higher than your 35%.  Or does your figure say a bomb
missed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target,
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  Such methods
are used all the time to lie with statistics.


I have _never_ seen any source that was claiming such a figure.  Please
post the source so its reliability can be judged.
