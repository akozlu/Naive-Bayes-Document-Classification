And here's my two cents:

The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but
you're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room
of a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car
ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates
like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.

The targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles.
