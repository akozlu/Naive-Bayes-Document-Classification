Whoa!  Watch your terminology.  "Dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost".
You'll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!"
Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the "dealer invoice"
(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers
on it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers
signify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the
salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere
on the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and
most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,
low voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actual
dealer cost".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual
dealer cost.
