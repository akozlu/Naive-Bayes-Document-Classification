Ahhh yes, Andrew, we meet again...

...no, not 'stealing' the oil, just draining it as to leave me stranded.


Let me guess, you're from Hudson Ohio??


Get out and see the world.


"IF" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew
something about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could
undo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.

As well as putting bad things in the gas...

While I would never vandalize someone's car, IF I were to, it would probably
be the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks
that way...
