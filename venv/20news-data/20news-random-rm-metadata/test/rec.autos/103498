Germans are just more organised; you can't blitz all of Europe in a
matter of , what, 9 months, unless you're pretty organised. If we tried
that, there'd just be a whole bunch of tanks backed up at the border,
waiting for some jerk in the right lane trying to get over to make a
left turn.

"This, of course, caused Germany to invade Belgium. One of the important
lessons of history is that anything, including late afternoon
thundershowers, will cause Germany to invade Belgium."
--Dave Barry
