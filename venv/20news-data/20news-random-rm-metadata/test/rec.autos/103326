You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated
by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.
 It also gives the amount of "threats" it is picking up, so if you go through
 the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the
 number of "threats" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.
  It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.
