Especially the '68 Shelby-American GT-500KR (King of the Road, so named
to steal GM's planned Camaro King of the Road's thunder :-)


Some GT-40s are street legal, some aren't.


I found my Shelby-American guide. There were a grand total 126 GT-40s
built:
		GT-40 Coupes		55
		GT-40 Road Cars		31
		GT-40 Mk II		13
		GT-40 Mk IIIs		 7
		GT-40 Roadsters		 5
		Mirages			 3
		GT-40 Mk IVs		12
		   	TOTAL:	       126
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	6-12

Twelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;
eight Mk II coupes; 4 LHD Mk IIIs; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs. The other 
breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.

The prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million
mark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or
thereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that
was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing
team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory
broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.

Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of
this information comes from "Hot Rod" magazine's "Shelby American
Cobra/Mustang Guide," which has more info on the Shelby-American 
Fords than you could _ever_ want to know.
