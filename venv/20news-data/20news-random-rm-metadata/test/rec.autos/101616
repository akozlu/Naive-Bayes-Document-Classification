My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these "real"
platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my '80 Fiesta and my dad
had 'em in his '84 Bronco--note the keyword "had." They didn't last
very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced.
I agree that they weren't the greatest.)
