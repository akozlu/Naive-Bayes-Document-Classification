	I was hoping for something like "The chassis exhibits X 
degrees of flex when subjected to forces of more than Y units.
Forces of more than Y units begin to manifest at Z miles per hour."

	Not "Well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast because, uhh,
well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast.  It's not a Porsche, you
know".


	Well, as compared to the normal Taurus, the SHO comes
with more supportive seats,better brakes,a stiffer suspension,
different tires, and a body design that takes advantage of aero
effects to keep the car on the ground (or at least I think that's
what all that boy-racer plastic is for).  You're kidding yourself if
you think any car on the road has a passenger compartment made to
withstand 130 MPH impacts.  


	Oh, right.  Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast.
They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon
a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.


	Of course not.  "Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal. 
I-will-not-speed.  I-love-Big-Brother."  You had your mind made up
already.

	It's interesting that lots of the roads out west had *NO*
speed limits until 1975.
