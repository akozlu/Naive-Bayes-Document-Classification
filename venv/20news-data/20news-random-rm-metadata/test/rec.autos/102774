You make it sound like this behavior is new.  It isn't.  A lot of
pedestrian bridges have fencing that curls up over the sidewalk to
make this kind of think a lot harder to do.

I don't understand the mentality myself, but then again I couldn't
figure out MOVE! (I'm glad they bombed 'em) or the Waco Wackos either.
