A mileage chart should be available in the book.  It usually goes by
the class of car you own and year.  Usually you will end up adding a few
hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it...  Consumer
Reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area.
A friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service.  I
believe it cost about $10.00.
