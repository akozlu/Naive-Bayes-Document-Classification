For an all out sports car, I'd go for the RX-7 without the sports
suspension (which is too stiff.)  For a little more practicality and more
comfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy.  And for a good dose of
luxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.) 
However, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks,
the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like.  I don't
particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car.
