First $50.00 grabs it! It's a Sears Kenmore 700 Watt unit FYI.

This unit has been sold. Thank you for your replies!

There is another oven available for those still interested. My mother
decided to sell her spare. Same price, $50.00 to the first taker.

Her's is strictly microwave, no convection, and is in equally good
condition. Same size as our's, approximately 4-5 cubic feet.

Let me know!
