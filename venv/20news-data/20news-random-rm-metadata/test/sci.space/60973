I presume the one you refer to is "Space Sailing" by Jerome L. Wright.  He 
worked on solar sails while at JPL and as CEO of General Astronautics.  I'll
furnish ordering info upon request.

The Friedman book is called "Starsailing: Solar Sails and Interstellar Travel."
It was available from the Planetary Society a few years ago, I don't know if
it still is.
