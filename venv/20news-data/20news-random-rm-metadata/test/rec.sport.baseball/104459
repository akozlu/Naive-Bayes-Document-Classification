Hey Valentine, I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their
fingers.  Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
future.  Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best 
signing.  And don't tell me Boston will win this year.  They won't 
even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.
