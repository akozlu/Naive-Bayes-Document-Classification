Hey!  What's this?  We agree!

No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).

Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters,
	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with
	slow curves and change ups.

Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel
	is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.

Both players started the game hitting below .200.  

There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted
	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game
	*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.

Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do
I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the
clutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...

Then again.  If it's not...
