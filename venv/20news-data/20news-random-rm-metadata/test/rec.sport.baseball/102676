That is great to hear I just may have to take a raod trip to Milwakee this year and see that again.  Last time I saw Bernie Brewer was at the age of 10 and I am now 21 thanks for this post.


Good to Bill is getting better form the limited coverage we get here in Iowa
I know that this will be a great season for the BREW CREW!!
