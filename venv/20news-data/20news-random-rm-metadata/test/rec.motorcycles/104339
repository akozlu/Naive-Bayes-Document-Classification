Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me
wonder who's going to carry cinder blocks on a bike(?!?!?) or is 
ready to do serious damage (key carvings etc.) to a cage.  Then I
had an idea--chain lube isn't just for chain's anymore!!!  It seems
more reasonable to me, no permanent damage but lots of work to get
off!  (Don't ask me how I know :)  Use it anywhere, the windshield,
the door handles, in the keyhole, etc.  What a nasty mood I'm in.
It's raining again...
