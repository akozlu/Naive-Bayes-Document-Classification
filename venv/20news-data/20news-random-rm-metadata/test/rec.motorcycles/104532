In New Orleans, LA, there was a company making motorcycles for WHEELCHAIR 
bound people!  The rig consists of a flat-bed sidecar rig that the 
wheelchair can be clamped to.  The car has a set of hand controls mounted on 
conventional handlebars!  Looks wierd as hell to see this legless guy 
driving the rig from the car while his girlfriend sits on the bike as a 
passenger!
