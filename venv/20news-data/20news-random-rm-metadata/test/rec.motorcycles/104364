Not too hard to remember, I bought a GS1000 new in '78. :-) It was
3rd place in the '78 speed wars (behind the CBX & XS Eleven) with a
11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. That wouldn't even make a good 600
these days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the
only thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS
across three states than any of the 600's.

I guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 12
second 400 didn't seem too far out of line.
