My reason for saying that was 'cause _I_, if _I_ were a cop
wouldn't go out of my way to tell people how to break the law.

Would you?

The part about honesty was a joke, sorta.

Obviously, people have had bad experiences with cops
lying.  Obviously, nobody's perfect and nobody
_always_ tells the truth about everything.

(Or are you God? 1/4 ;)
