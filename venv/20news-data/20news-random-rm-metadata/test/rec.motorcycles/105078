 

My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up.  I'll tell you 
what we've found and the systems we've worked out.

- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something
and leaning forward.  Remember this.

- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally 
this means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.
Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.

- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough 
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding 
onto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which 
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.

- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not 
out wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.

- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.
Normally this means "slow down, and do it now!".  



We only have a couple signals.  "Slow down" is her either tapping me on 
the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency
of the matter :-)

"Turn here" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is
also the sign for "cool!  Look at that."  "I hafta pee" is the same sign
as "turn here".  "I'm hungry" is the same sign.  "Go faster" is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see "slow
down" more often than "go faster".
 

The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and 
pillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're 
in almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because
you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely
feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes
at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  
Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.

Also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up
than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and
"in the Zen of the moment" less.  Remember this.
