So, hey, like, does this work the other way? If I was to like, you
know, strap a generator to my FZJRR11000KRX and route its output to
the chain, could I increase the horsepower? 32 meters a sec is
pretty nice and all, but, I'd still like to be able to blow away 
a Goldwing without going to nitro...
