*cough* *choke*  WHAT?!?  if a cop gave me a ticket for "sounding" like
i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply
because "sounding" like speeding is ridiculous.  if i was found guilty
i'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer.

if a cop doesn't do one of:

VASCAR (from car or plane)
RADAR, LIDAR, other electronic speed measuring device
pace me

and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court.  i can accept a
cop "seeing" me going excessively fast (like 25+ over the limit) but
"he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone" is not "beyond a
reasonable doubt".  granted i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measured
by eye???  take it to court for sure.
