Utah raster toolkit using getx11. Convert your sun raster files (presumably) to 
ppm with the pbm+ toolkit then convert ppm to utah rle format with ppmtorle which
is provided in the toolkit.

I seem to remember that Xloadimage can do 24 bit servers too.

Possibly xwud the x window un-dump program can display 24 bit images; certainly
xwd can grab them.
