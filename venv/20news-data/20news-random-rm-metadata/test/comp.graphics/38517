There are several public domain utilities available at your usual
archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl
file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp.  The problem 
is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
the many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome!
Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities.
Hope it helps.
