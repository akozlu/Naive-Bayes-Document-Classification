The problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! The IJG's code is
pretty good if you ask me, and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision.

Try getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.

Specifically "JPEG Still Image Compression Standard" by Pennebaker & Mitchell,
VNR 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.

BTW. I presume your comment about "good" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive
as it does.
