Hi,
It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.
But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ).
So I'm not much interested in Amiga news. 

In the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this
newgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.

I would suggest to split the group. I don't see the problem of cross-posting.
Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size. 

BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
TRAFFIC A LOT.

Sincerely, Gerhard
