I have a very large (3x5 feet) file in Macintosh Canvas v2.something
which I need to import into AutoCad 12 in the least disk-space intensive
way possible.  (i.e. EPS is a big problem, since it took 1.3 MEG to encode
one page of the document)  The file is entirely lines and words.  I have
access to networked Macs & PC's, and ftp.  Can anyone suggest how this might
be accomplished?  Email replies, if you would, I don't read this group much.
Thanks in advance.
