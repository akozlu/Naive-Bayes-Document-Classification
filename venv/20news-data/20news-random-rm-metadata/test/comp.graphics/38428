That is in fact the current version (it only came out in December).


My test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn't being scaled up.
Scaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime (1.0);
the current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240),
but even so, I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as
with playing back an actual 320*240 movie. I haven't done any numerical
measurements for scaled playback.
