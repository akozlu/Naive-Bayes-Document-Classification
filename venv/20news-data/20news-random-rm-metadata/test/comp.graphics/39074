Actually, IFF is a *format standard*.  It is not a picture file format, sound
file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).
The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and
it's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORM's I believe.
