I understand there have been a couple of raves in LA billing themselves as
"Virtual Reality" parties. What I hear they do is project .GIF images around
on the walls, as well as run animations through a Newtek Toaster.

Seems like we need to adopt the term Really Virtual Reality or something, except
for the non-immersive stuff which is Virtually Really Virtual Reality.


etc.
