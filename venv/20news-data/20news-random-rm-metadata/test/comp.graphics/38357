	The VESA standard can be requested from VESA:
	VESA
	2150 North First Street, Suite 440
	San Jose, CA 95131-2029

	Ask for the VESA VBE and Super VGA Programming starndards.  VESA
	also defines local bus and other standards.

	The VESA standard only addresses ways in which an application
	can find out info and capabilities of a specific super VGA
	implementation and to control the video mode selection
	and video memory access.

	You still have to set your own pixels.


	VESA defines a "window" that is used to access video memory.
	This window is anchored at the spot where you want to write,
	and then you can write as far as the window takes you (usually
	64K).  Windows have granularities, so you can't just anchor 
	them anywhere.  Also, some implementations allow two windows.


	This is VESA mode 101h.  There is a Set Display Start function
	that might be useful for scrolling.


	Your best bet is to write VESA for the info.  There have also
	been announcements on this group of VESA software.
