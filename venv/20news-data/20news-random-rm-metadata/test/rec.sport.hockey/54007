Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM
deleted.  Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league.
I think Quinn is one of several who are better.


When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they 
regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs
the year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the
team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.

When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a
contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup
contender.

So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.
Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.
