I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the
Vezina.  I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates
this year.  I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin
receive for their goaltending.  I do think that they are great in the nets,
but I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years
playoffs.  The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front
of them and the goaltenders get the most credit.  I would rather face 25 shots
a game, than have to rely on Joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to
face 35 shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them.

ps Go Quebec!!!  And I know that McLean and several others should be mentioned
as candidates for this years Vezina, but I am partial to Joseph and Barrasso
this season.
