Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who
retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?
After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.
Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in
reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he
played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,
unless you're a franchise player.
