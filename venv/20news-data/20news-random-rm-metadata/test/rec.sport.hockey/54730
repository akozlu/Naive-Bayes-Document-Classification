If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling
as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their
advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their
superior powerplay. 

Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on
his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is
truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, 
were quite stoppable.
