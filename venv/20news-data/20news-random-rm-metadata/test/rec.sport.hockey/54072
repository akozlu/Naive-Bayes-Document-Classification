OK, here is my try:

				        Lukko, Finland
					(look at the colors of his mask)
					              
				        ex-JyPHT, Finland, now in Germany
					Excellent defenseman

					HIFK, Finland

				        Tappara, Finland

					HPK, Finland

					Jokerit, Finland
	
				        HPK, Finland

				        JyPHT, Finland, no new contract
					JyPHT owns his player rights

All of these Czechs (Kadlec, Dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey
players. It is a big surprise that Hlinka selected Dolezal. 
"Dole" had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make
a new contract. The other Czech we had, Jiri Jonak, got fired also.
