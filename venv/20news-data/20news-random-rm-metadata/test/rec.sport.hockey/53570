Well, I don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist 
who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression
came from _him_ (Steve Simmons?).  Besides, to my knowledge Alex has a pretty
fair grasp of the English language...and his recent comment after the Detroit
game would indicate that this remark _is_ what I think it to be.  Very low.
