Looks like Bob Errey's ring really sparkles in that locker room, and everyone
else wants one, too! :-)  Correct me if I'm wrong though, (just through
the net, not through e-mail, I don't need 100 rl's in my e-mail!) but wasn't
Boston down 2-0 vs. Buffalo last year?Boston lost 1 and 2 at home and won
3 and 4 in Buffalo.  Whoever wins game 3 will advance.  Simple as that!!! :-)
