I'm familiar with the telethon situation (an individual on CompuServe
was also victimized and was equally pissed).  That was a local
television station contract which could not be broken.  For that item,
I strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on
them.  (Supposedly one station had told my friend that they have
received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less
incentive to pre-empt hockey telecasts in future.  The contract was
written when the pathetic WLAF was in that time slot.)
