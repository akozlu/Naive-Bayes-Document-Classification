For those of you who complain about Don Cherry, and wonder why he is
popular...

the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and
Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell.

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team
a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry
sings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one
doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
lost his marbles.

Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
that college with outrageous statements.

Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters
in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey?   Canadians
are very similar to Americans...culturally our sports are just hockey
and curling, whereas with Americans it is football/basketball/baseball
and bowling.
