: How hot should the CPU in a 486-33 DX machine be?

: Currently it gets so hot that I can not hold a finger on it for more than
: 0.5 s. 

I seem to recall that 486s run somewhere close to the boiling point of water.
Anyone have an exact temperature?

Anyway, putting a CPU fan/heat sink on it won't hurt and could help. Depends
on how paranoid you are...
