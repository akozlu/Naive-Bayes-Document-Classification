I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM
laptop - the PC Convertible.  If you have one of these things, and
still are using it, you may have found out that IBM wants OUTRAGEOUS
prices for parts.  I built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine
going for a few years, and will be willing to part with the rest.

Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT:

Motherboard
Battery
Power Supply

I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask.

These are in very limited supply, however.  I've basically just cannibalized
a couple of old machines.

If you are interested, please e-mail me.
