It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing!

I'm not sure about DOS, but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this


loop:
	is there anything to do?
		YES -> do it; goto loop
		NO  -> goto loop


The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...

It will also respond to interupts...
