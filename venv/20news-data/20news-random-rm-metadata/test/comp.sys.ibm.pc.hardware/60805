	This is pure bull.  I've had the 24 bit mode (640x480 and 800x600)
	working since the version before 59 (??55??).  Bld 59 added 
	the 24 bit option to Flexpanel.  Try getting the drivers from 
	ftp.cica.indiana.edu or wuarchive.
Mine is:
Gateway 486 DX2/50 LB
8 Megs ram
IDE HD
ATI GUP w/ 2MB (installed upgrade myself)
BLD 59 drivers.
