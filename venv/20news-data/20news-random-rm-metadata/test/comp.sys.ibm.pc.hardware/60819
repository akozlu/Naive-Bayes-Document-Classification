I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5") and ideally would like to
be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single PC.
[Yes, I know that services to do this exist.] 

I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
at a time. I know that some controllers are available that can handle 4 
floppies with serialized access. I know that microchannel machines can keep 
more than one floppy active simultaneously. But does anyone have a controller 
for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going?
How about for an EISA machine?

If the limitation is a software limitation, I can work around that by using
OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286.

New or used, I'm interested.
