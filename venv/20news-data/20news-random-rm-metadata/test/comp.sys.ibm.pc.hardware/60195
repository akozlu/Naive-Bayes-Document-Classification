Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17" monitors recently
and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.
This monitor can be had for around $1070.

Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a
17" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember
correctly, I think its viewing area is 16" measured diagonally.

Thanks.
