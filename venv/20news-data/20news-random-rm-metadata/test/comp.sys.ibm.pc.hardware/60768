Yep.  I've done this, too.  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
down on the "latch" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  Label
each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled
them out.  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals
to get the correct orientation.
