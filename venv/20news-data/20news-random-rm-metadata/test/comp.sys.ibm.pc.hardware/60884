Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.




Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have
paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is
cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).


The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from
0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the
same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed
(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
lousy.


The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.


Just some view, not much figures.
