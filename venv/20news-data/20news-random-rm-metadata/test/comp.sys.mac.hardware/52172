 This is a pet peeve of mine. I wish companies would put power switches on the
 front of the equipment! If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front, I
 would happily power it off at night. Almost every piece of computer equipment
 I own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and
 modems--why?). I hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon.
