I've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is NOT a
result of the 8/24GC board! Try Zapping the PRAM by holding down
"Command-Option-P-R" durring startup! You will have to reset everything to
your previous preferences (The Date & Time remain intact!), but the Video
Board will start remembering it's previous settings!
