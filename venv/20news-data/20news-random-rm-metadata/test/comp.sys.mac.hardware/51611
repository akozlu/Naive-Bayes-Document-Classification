I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0, 
and it works on System7.  Course, I only use the SWA Dutch
and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size
requirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have 40pnt definition
to print a 10pnt font)  When I upgraded,  I talked to Orange
Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely
works with System7.  However, the upgrade was US$40, so I
passed.

Hope this helps?
