Hi, there!
I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300. I've been told,
however, that:
1. The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines
   with SCSI-2.
2. The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
   capability, which I need.
3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150.

Any comments?
Thanx.
