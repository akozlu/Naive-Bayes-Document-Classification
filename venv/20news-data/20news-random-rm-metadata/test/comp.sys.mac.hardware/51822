    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are
two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.


    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with
an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU.


    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.

 
    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.


    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full
040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.


    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated
countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware
designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that
the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.
