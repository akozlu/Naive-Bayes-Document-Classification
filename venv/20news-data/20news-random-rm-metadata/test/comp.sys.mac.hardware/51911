The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will
bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective
resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend
to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would
work better for images.
