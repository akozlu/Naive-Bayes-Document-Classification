Ok, I have a question... why?  Why do people copy the article, and the 
only new thing they add to the post is there name?  I'm not picking on 
this person, I've seen a few of these.  Is it just a mistake?  Am I 
missing something?  Is it some unknown net-equette I missed somewhere?
I skip over all the quoted material, since I've already read it, and look 
for the non-quoted material, and all I get is the name addition.  Is this 
supposed to me "I agree", or "I second this" or what?

Sorry...
