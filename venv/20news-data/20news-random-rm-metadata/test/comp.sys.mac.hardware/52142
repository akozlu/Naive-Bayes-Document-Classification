Does GX take the place of 32 bit QD or add to it? Right now 32 bit is
kinda aesthetically a pain in a few places because of hacks upon hacks
to maintain compatibility with original QD---I think of things like
where you have to cast CGrafPorts to GrafPorts and such. It would be a
lot cleaner to ditch this entire mess and start over---do we get that?
