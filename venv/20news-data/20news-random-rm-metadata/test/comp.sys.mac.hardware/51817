    To display Millions of colors on a 16" monitor you need 2MB of VRAM
in the Q950.


    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes
with.


    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only
knows 1MB and 2MB.


    Yes, this is correct. You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800's motherboard.
