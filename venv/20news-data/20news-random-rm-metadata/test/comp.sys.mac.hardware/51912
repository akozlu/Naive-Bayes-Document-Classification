Just my luck.  I did however call my local Apple dealer and he said that
the he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin
with either 70 or 53-56, and maybe one other.  He also told me that Apple
had extended the service on these serial numbers for another year!!!  

So there is still hope - Get those monitor in!!
