I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they 
intended to do, "orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and
a holocaust" would never have come to pass.

The BD's killed members of the BATF on the first day. "Orchestrated character
assassination and noise torture" seem like a small retribution.  The use
of tanks is quesionable however.
