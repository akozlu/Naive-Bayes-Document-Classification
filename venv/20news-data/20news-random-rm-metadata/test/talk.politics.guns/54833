The Houston Chronicle last Thursday (maybe Wednesday) said that
the interior of walls had been covered with hay bales to help
protect against bullets.  Many of you know how fast dry hay
burns.


In addition, the gas is specifically designed to force eyes
closed and the victim to vomit.  How fast could you leave your
burning office or home if your eyes were closed and you were
retching violently?
