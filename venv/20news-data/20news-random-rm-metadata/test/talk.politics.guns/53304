Wow, the scope of the mission of the ATF continues to expand.  Besides
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, they now seem to be involded in Child
Protective Services, Drug Enforcement and Tax Evasion.

They look to be on the road to being the nations *boys in blue*!
No Knock in one hand, M-16 in the other.  Zeik-Heil!!!
