The suggestion that they Davidians committed suicide is
completely without evidence.  Except for the editorials...

Please re-word.  "propensity for allegedly dousing themselves".

Oh, and the survivors claim the the FBI started the burning
by accidentally igniting kerosene lanterns (remember that they'd
already cut the power), and the propane tanks.  This sounds
a lot more likely than committing suicide by setting the place
afire.
