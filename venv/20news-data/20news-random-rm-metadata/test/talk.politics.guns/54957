Um, I sortof hesitate to bring this up, but owning even a single share
entitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting, and under most
corporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed.  While I *don't*
suggest the tactic used by some in Japan (go to the shareholders meeting,
and disrupt the bejeezus out of everything), what about a well-worded
resolution complaining about "advocacy journalism"?
