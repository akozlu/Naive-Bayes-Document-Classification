Only as far as it affects the crime rate.

Did the RATE of crime fall?  If not, the ban was of no use.  It is the rate of  
violent crime that matters, not the tools used.  "It's the crime, stupid!"


Apparently that became the weapon of choice after the shotguns were banned.   
After that, they'll decide the car of choice  is the Saab, and propose a ban on  
that!


Yes.  We still trust honest people here.  For the time being.
