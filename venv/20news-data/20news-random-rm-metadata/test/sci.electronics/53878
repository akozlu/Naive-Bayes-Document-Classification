I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.  If you program
is any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be
distributing the stripped version is well under a week.

Hardware methods prevent J. Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate 
your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough 
connections to "real" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your "check for the 
hole" code.

You may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad
higher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few
potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose
numbers don't change with the price).

As for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  Of course, a lot of pirates just
have this "thing" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,
so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  Even so, 20% is awfully
low.
