My own practice with new software :

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies.

install to hard drive from second set of floppies.

put originals in a box in room number one.

put copies in box in room number two.

1) Accidents DO happen to original floppies.
2) Accidents CAN happen to the installation floppy.
3) Sometimes software goes out on floppies that are JUST marginally good.  Or
   gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage.

I've had experience with SOMETHING like the last.  I purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor.  THe debugger in the package just would NOT install to the
hard drive. NO WAY.  Repeated floppy-to-floppy copies FINALLY got a clean read
of the disk.  I DON'T recall if I used "diskcopy", "copy/b", or "xcopy".

I made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that.  No problenms ( except with my typing :-)  ) since.

I regard backup floppies as CHEAP insurance.

Just my side of the question...
