It sorta depends on what you drive. I remember running a two channel 
Motorola with a vibrator power supply and about 40 tubes in a 1958 
Volkwagen. The poor little 6 V generator had a heck of a time, and if you 
keyed the mic at night, you needed to be stationary, because your lights 
got AWFUL DIM. Isn't progress wonderful?
