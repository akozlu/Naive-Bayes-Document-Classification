I am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular American phone
on your home system. I vaguely remember a few years ago, when "Deutsche
Bundespost" split into Postdienst, Postbank, and Telekom there was some
discussion about a new regulation. I know that cordless or cellular phones
still have to be approved by the Telekom, but does that hold true for regular
phones? In my areacode in Germany (2234 - Frechen, near Koeln) you can use
touch-tone dialing. I assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively
set to pulse dialing. Last time I checked (Jan '93) the Cologne areacode 221
was still solely pulse dialing.

BTW, touch tone does become more common in Germany, bringin with it the
flourishing of 1-900 services (in Germany 0190). I just hope we'll all have
ISDN some time at an affordable price - idle wishes...
