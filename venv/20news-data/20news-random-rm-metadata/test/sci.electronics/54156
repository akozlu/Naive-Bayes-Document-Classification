     I have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal.  I simply
ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply, +/- 8V in this case.   As long as your
analog input signal stays between the supply rails, the 4066 will work fine.
Of course, your control (logic) input must use -8V as the logic LOW and
+8V as the logic HIGH reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic
must be 4000 CMOS with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide
some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the
control logic.  In my case, I was able to use the bipolar supply all the
way.
