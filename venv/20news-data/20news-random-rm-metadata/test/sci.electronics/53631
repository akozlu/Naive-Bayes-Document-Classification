	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower).  Third, liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air.


	Cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium?  This is a
toxic heavy metal, even if it WEREN'T radioactive.  Shouldn't there
be some smileys here?  Or frowneys?
