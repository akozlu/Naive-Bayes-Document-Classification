There are a number of inaccuracies here:
1) In fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly.  This is why
   batteries should be stored in a COOL, dry place.
2) An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
   on wood.  The battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the
   same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus
   none will effect the other.


There is no need to 'exercise' the battery.  Just keep it charged.  (A trickle
charger will do the job.)
