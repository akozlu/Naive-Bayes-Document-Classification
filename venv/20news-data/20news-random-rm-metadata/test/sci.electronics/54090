YOU.  Sure, you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes,
but WHY?  It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking.

Nothing, but if you read my WHOLE suggestion, I'm saying that you register
via MAIL by mailing in your registration card, THEN the company send you
the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card.
