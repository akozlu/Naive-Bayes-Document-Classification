Sorry Charlie...

I have a dozen, VERY blue LED's on my bench right now. They have
a clear plastic case and when lit, are absolutely BLUE. The hue
is sort of a "summer day cloudless sky blue" but make no mistake,
they are blue.

You can buy them from Digikey, Circuit Specialist, Jameco (I think),
LED-Tronics, Stanley Optoelectronics, and others. The current price
is around $2.50 each for small quantities. I will also be selling
them through my mail-order company in the near future (4 weeks).
Write for details if interested.
