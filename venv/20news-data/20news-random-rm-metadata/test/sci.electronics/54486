All the equipment has to have that Telekom approval number to be

What has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else.
I'm pretty sure the same holds true in Sweden (at least when I read

And BTW I do know that most of the lines in Sweden can handle tone-dialing,
just don't be sure that all can.
