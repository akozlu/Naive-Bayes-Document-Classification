Wow, hang on a second.  The libertarian party stands for personal freedom,
lassez-faire economics and minimal government.  Whoever is describing the
self as a Libertarian (maybe you were refering to the posters who call 
themselves civil libertarians) are not talking at all about Libertarian
philosophy.
