BIGOTRY"

Biden spoke well.  Then there was John Major, the architect of the
betrayal of Bosnian Muslims to genocide.  

He basically has given yet another green light to HVO Ustashe and
Mladic-Chetnik serial killers, rapists, and plunderers to continue their
genocide against Bosnian Muslims.

But Major met with Mr. Rushdie and said it was "unacceptable" that Iran
should have a death decree on him.  While I disagree personally with
Fetwas against hack writers like Rushdie (it only helps them sell more
books), I find it interesting that Mr. Major finds the genocide of two
million Muslims in Bosnia acceptable, but a threat against one single
popular British writer "unacceptable."
