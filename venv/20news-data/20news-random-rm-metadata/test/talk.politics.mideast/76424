And anyone who doesn't agree with you is, by your own definitions, a
"useless fart".  Just like any text that disputes your own "findings"
is always described as "flawed" or "biased".  In other words, you

We've seen you play these games here for a long time.

One thing is for sure: When it comes to "useless farts", you sure know 
what you're talking about.
