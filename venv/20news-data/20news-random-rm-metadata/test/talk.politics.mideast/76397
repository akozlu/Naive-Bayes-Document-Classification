That operation was done by a small Jewish fraction BEFORE the state even
existed and, as far as I remember, was disaproved by most of the Jews.

Saying that "He was killed by the Israelis" is plain wrong because there wasn't
"Israel" at the time.

And as far as the Jews liked the idea of having part of the land you can see
their reaction to the UN resolution from 29 November,  and the Arab's reaction
too  (no,  it wasn't that the Arabs danced in the streets with doznes of Jewish
states invading them but quite the other way around).
