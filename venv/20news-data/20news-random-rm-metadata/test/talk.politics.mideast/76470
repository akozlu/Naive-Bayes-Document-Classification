	No one is forced to blow up airplanes.  Terrorism is a choice
made by people because they do not want to work for peace.


	There are *lots* of military targets in Israel.  There are
lots of legitamate targets in Israel.  Old ladies, children, and
civilians in general are not acceptable targets.

	If the only person you can kill is a civilian, you hold your
fire.  If that means you can't kill anyone, then you can't kill
anyone.  Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they
are easy kills is rediculous.


	Did they make a policy of it?


	Did you mean excuse? :)  Killing a soldier and killing a
civilian are two very different acts.


	No, they killed soldiers so that the British government would
leave.  The objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost
of staying was way too high.  

	In contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other
civilains.  They use random violence against people to make a point
that no one is safe until their demands are met.  An analogy would be
the Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing.


	Thats because you missed the essential point of arab
terrorism, which is to scare civilains away from Israel, by killing
those who have something to do with Israel.  It is to kill Jews
because they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in
Israel because of where they live.  The targets are rarely soldiers,
or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of
duty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one
who deals with Israel is safe.


	Oh, you mean you favor the Israelis, outnumbered 2 to 1,
outgunned, surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a
peace treaty in 45 years?  You favor the Jews, people like Leon
Klofhinger, a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was Jewish?
You support the right of the Jewish people to live in peace?

	Why, thank you for your support.
