Only Brendan McKay, or maybe ARF, would come to the rescue of Nazi
racial theory.  Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any
eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks
of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire "problem"
as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East,
and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of
his "even-handed" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what 
he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine:
rectification of the "abnormal presence" of the Jewish people within a 
larger body politic.  Whether your "solution" involves gas, monetary 
incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has 
said, "disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal 
surrounding Arab culture," you are engaged in a Nazi project.

Just as obvious is your statement: "I will not comment on the value
or lack of value of Elias's proposal."  Still striking the glancing
blow, right Brendan?  You could easily see where he was going, but you
"will not comment."  So, you are complicitous.

What is your fascination with Nazi racial theory, anyway?
