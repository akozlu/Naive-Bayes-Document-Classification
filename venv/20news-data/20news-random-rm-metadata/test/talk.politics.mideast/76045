Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more
difficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in
any way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support
this?

I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan
had been writing it.

Newsflash:
Cairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red
Sea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of
the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea.
The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.
Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been
denied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers
were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the
Red Sea to return to their normal state.  Unfortunately they suffered
heavy casualties while doing so.
