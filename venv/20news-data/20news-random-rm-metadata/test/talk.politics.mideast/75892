Dorin,
Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The
distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people
whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these
soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And
resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich
were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).
Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by
resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the
Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the
hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the
Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the
only option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving
out the US)
