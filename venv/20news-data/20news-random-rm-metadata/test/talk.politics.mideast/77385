This is a very impotant update, I will omit just a few lines, and add
some "overhead" for the sake of the copyright :-)

I say despite all the bad news for Muslims around the world, things are
shaping up very well, a lot of killings might happen in the near future,
though (as if Bosnia is not a lot).
Right now, I feel like saying what Martillo said : "the stage is set".
I don't think that things will be the same in ten year, 
On the pessimistic/realistic side, we can only see the stage set for more
wars imposed on our people, and governments being remote controlled.
to fight each other and to oppress their own people, but I am confident
they will all fall:
I venture to list the order: Sudan/Yemen alliance, Algeria/Libya in 5 years,
Tunisia one year later but Egypt may face direct colonization very soon to
prevent an Islamic government which might take over after Egypt attacks 
SUdan and is envolved in atrocities there as it fails to achieve
victory.  Meanwhile Saudia faces a civil war and goes to war 
with Yemen/Sudan over it,  The new North African 
Alliance (Algeria/Tun/Libya) goes to war with Morocco who attacks it.
U.S/France involved everywhere but cannot concentrate on one place, 
especially that Syria/Jordan/Iraq have to be kept under control.

After the cloud clears, I do not know what the end result will be,

O.K back to reality:

 	CAIRO, Egypt (UPI) -- The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human
 Rights (AOHR) Sunday called on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to order the
 release of members of the kingdom's first human rights group.
