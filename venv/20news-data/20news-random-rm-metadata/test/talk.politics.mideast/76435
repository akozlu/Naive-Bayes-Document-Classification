	This was posted fairly recently.  There has been much more
racist stuff in the past.  Why are we expected to listen to it and

However, the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have
an irrational dislike for Israel and Jews.  Perhaps if you took a
close look at what you've posted thought a bit about the combatative
tone you've used, you would see why people are reacting the way they
are.
