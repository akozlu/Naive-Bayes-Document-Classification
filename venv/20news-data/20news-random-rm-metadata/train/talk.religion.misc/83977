    Interesting idea.

    This suggestion has inspired me to post, under the title "Theories 
of Creation", a collection of various "philosophies" of creation that 
I am aware of.  Could you explain which of these theories you would
want taught, and which ones you would not?  Or, perhaps, I haven't
included a favorite theory of yours (if so, could you describe it for
me for inclusion in an updated list)?
