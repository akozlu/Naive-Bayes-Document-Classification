/So. Why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative.


I don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative.

What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that 
you don't have the right to tell others what to think.

I think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is 
a respect for human life and the dignity of the person.  It is all the
stuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between 
primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us.

/Maybe (the insane lover of pain might reason) if other people experienced
/enough pain, they might learn to enjoy it, too.  

Fine.  There is still the clinical definition of crazy.  And this also
involves a violation of free will, because the insane lover of your
little example would be inflicting pain on a non-willing subject.

Try again.

/You have to have some sort of premise about choice or self-awareness.


No, you do not.  I demonstrated to you the example of the football
team which doesn't require premises about freedom of choice or 
sentience/self-awareness.
