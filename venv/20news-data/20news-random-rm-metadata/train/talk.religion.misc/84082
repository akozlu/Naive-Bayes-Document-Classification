He is God.


He is God.


God granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.
 

The scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour.  He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For
example, let's say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist
would not hesitate in killing it.

God creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in 
our love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him.
God cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God,
one that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is
worthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy.
 

God is God.  Who are we to question the Creator?  If you doubt God's doing
in certain situations, do you claim to know a better solution?  Would you
be playing the role of God?
