Hmm...are you a Taoist?  Imposing limits *does* do something useful...it gives
you something to go beyond.


I tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of Taoism.  I especially
tend to frown on any suggestion that "orthodoxy" or "classics" have any
special place in Tao.


So rather than debate what "Taoism *REALLY* means" you are suggesting that
we take someone else's word for it and work thusly?  I'd rather not, thank
you.


Whereas you, of course, have a clear idea of what the word means?  Can
you tell the Tao? :-)


Wonderful idea.


Only if you choose to define failure in that way.  Or to define it at all.
