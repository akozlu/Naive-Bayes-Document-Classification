The idea of an apostacy did not originate with Lucy Smith or Joseph
Smith or the Mormons.  The idea of a restoration was quite common
in the early 19th century USA.  Alexander Campbell, founder of the
group that now survives with the name "Disciples of Christ" preached
that the primitive church had been lost and was attempting to restore
it (although not be revelations).  Many Cambellites subsequently became
Mormons, including co-founder Sidney Rigdon.  Actually, you can find
such sentiments in many of the early protestants of the reformation,
such as Martin Luther.
