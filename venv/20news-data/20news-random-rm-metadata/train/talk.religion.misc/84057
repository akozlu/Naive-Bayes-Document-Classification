 

["it" is Big Bang]

Since you asked... from the Big Bang to the formation of atoms is about
10E11 seconds. As for the "color": bright. Very very bright. 


I don't. I believe the current theory of cosmology because it is fairly
well supported by observational evidence (not as well supported as, say
evolution or relativity, but that's another matter). You're the one who
proposes unquestioningly accepting religious dogma as fact (apologies if
you're not actually a creationist).


The line is broader than you think. Theories are supported by evidence.
Miracles are supported by someone's say-so.
