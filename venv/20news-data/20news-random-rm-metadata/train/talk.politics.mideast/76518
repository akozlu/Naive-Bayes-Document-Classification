Thank you, Brad/Ali, for warning us about the dangers of propaganda.
It's funny, though, coming from you.


Who is it that executes these "pin-point attacks" on Israelis?  The
guys in the white hats or the ones in the black hats?  Neither?  You
mean that they are just civilians, farmers, teachers, school children?
Well, maybe they ARE terrorists, after all?  And maybe that
"propaganda" was correct, too?  Hmm?
