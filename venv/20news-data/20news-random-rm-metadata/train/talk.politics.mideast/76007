When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became, in parts of Lebanon, an
Occupying Power itself, these same practices were common against
non-Palestinean and Palestinean alike.  They are simply Standard
Operating Procedures among Palestineans and have been for a very long
time.  In fact, the greatest bloodbath of Palestineans will happen
when they get self-rule.  Can you possibly deny this? 

When the PLO is the Occupier, who are you NOW going to blame?
