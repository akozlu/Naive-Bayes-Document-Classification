It is also so easy to blame the West for their indiffernce to
real Bosnian suffering.  How about the moslem world, about 1 billion?
How about them ha?  What they are doing to stop this
massacre?  Why the oil rich Arab states make the Bosnian crises 
a national interest of the West, especially for Europeans?  We all 
know they can do it over night, don't we? Blaming West and asking 
why they don't put their life into danger seems to be the choice of 
muslims too.  I think who is sleeping is not the West.  They are wide 
awake.  They are trying to save the face.
