Look up the facts first, post second.  Bernadotte was assassinated
in September 1948 by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders
(one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir).  There is no hard evidence of
complicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN
and other organizations (US intelligence, Swedish government) to
find it.  However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of
zeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers.  The Lehi
man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend
of David Ben-Gurion.  The best published account in English is A. Ilan, 
Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989).
