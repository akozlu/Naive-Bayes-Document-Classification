If we can't avoid throwing out gut-reactions to what we see as "extremist"
views here in the newsgroup, we're certainly not going to be any better at
it in the real world. Hey, it easy here. After reading the offending post, 
we can step back, take some deep breathing exercises, have a gallon of
ice cream (or sex, whichever calmsus), and reply in something other
than the usual king-of-the-hill mentality.  

Perhaps, starting here with an immediate "accusation" is not a particularly
good way to generate open responses? How about explaining what you see as
being Israel's *real worries* and how they *need* to be addressed? Since
the "other side" sees Israel's "gestures" in a completely different light
than you do, perhaps "they" also have *real worries*. From their point
of view, what are they? How can those worries be addressed? 

It is certainly much harder to "reach compromise" (or, even sit down
and talk with...) an other side which is fractured into several
different ideologies, each with its own set of "demands". While it is
up to "them" to generate unity on their side, is there anything that
Israel can do (without sacrificing its security, its position) to
encourage that unification along lines that Israel prefers?
