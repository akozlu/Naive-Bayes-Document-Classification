UPI, and the newspapers who are reporting this being all owned by Saudis
I wonder how secure they are feeling by reporting all of these things,
maybe Saudi Arabia is allowed to have all the human rights violations
it can have, nobody is including them in any list,.. those are designed
for independent states.


why is this reported from Cairo?

.....

Can somebody teach this man some logic?
what is the relationship between a human rights league in  Saudia
and human rights in Bosnia, I guess if we wanted to know what is
in Italy, we should know what is in Brasil (Syrian Joke)


their claim of following Islamic law is the biggest disservice
that they ever did to Islam.

...

But how about human rights in Egypt Mr Amin?
