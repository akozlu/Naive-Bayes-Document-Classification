Is this the same Monolithic, Centrally Controlled Media that you're always
talking about? Do you mean to tell me that the LA Times is the ONLY major
paper to buck the Media Spiking Division's activities?




Assumption: When one major newspaper prints three or more articles on the front
page regarding subject matter that is not strictly local, this is likely
to be considered an open story, and not a coverup.
 
Let's hear a roll call here. Anyone outside of the LA area seen articles on
this?
