Comparing Israel to Nazi Germany is name-calling of the lowest kind.
Please don't be disingenuous.


Do civil libertarians make no distinction between the Nazis and
Israel?  Would you say that the Iraqis are like the Nazis?

If you do not make such distinctions, then all injustices are
equally evil, and the world is a completely evil place.  In that
case, we may as well give up right now.
