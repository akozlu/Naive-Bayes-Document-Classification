	There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is 
important enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his 
garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).

	This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:

	- it is all in Arens' mind.
	- Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO
	- Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense 
Minister) was spying on him.
	- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.

	In any case, who cares?
