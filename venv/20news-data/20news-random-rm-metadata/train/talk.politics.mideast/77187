I just exchange ideas over the USENET with other people. I never 
attacked you as to put you in the need to defend yourself against me.
I am not a violent person, and I do not see how can anyone be threatened
by the opinions and ideas of others as expressed on USENET.
I asked you to continue on email because I am not interested on a
flamefest, where you change my words or just make up some of your own
and present them as mine.
So, do not worry. You do not need to defend yourself because I am not
attacking you.


This is a good advice for yourself.
