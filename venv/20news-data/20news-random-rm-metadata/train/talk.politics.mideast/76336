Absolutely. I'm sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased
if the fighters (military, guerilla, whatever) would just take their
argument elsewhere, find an unpopulated area somewhere, and slug it out.  
At that point, we will all breath a sigh of relief *and* cheer for
our side in the struggle.
