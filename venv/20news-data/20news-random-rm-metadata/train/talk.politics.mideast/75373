There certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of 
a global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, 
however, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the 
former) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force. 
I  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing 
"Islamicization" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same
approach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
power are certainly a threat.

To Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance
of those *outside* its own "group". If I am told that "I am not one of
you" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.
If I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic
world and *actively did not* accept my "minority" status, I *would also 
certainly* see Islam's domination as having been acheived, and maintained, 
through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities
within their ranks.

I am not a zionist, but do feel that *both* Jewish and Palestinian
nationalist desires need, at this juncture, to be accepted in some way.
For the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous
for Islam to be spread by force upon those who DO NOT WANT THAT. 


[I refer to the "most" you also refer to] 
Because they are scared, and feel very threatened, as well feeling that 
this area *is* to some degree part of their belief/religion/heritage/
identity/etc.
