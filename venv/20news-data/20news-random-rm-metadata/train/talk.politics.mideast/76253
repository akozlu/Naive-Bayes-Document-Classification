	All humans suffered emotionally, some Jews and many
others suffered physically. It is sad that people like you are
so blinded by emotions that they can't see the facts. Thanks
for calling me names, it only assures me of what kind of
ignorant people I am dealing with. I included your letter since
I thought it demonstrated my point more than anything I could
write.
