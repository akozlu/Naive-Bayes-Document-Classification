Hey tough guy, freedom necessitates responsibility, and
no freedom is absolute.  
BTW, to anyone who defends Arafat, read on:

"Open fire on the new Jewish immigrants, be they from the Soviet
Union, Ethiopia or anywhere else....I give you my instructions to
use violence against the immigrants.  I willjail anyone who
refuses to do this."
				Yassir Arafat, Al-Muharar, 4/10/90

At least he's not racist!
Just anti-Jewish
