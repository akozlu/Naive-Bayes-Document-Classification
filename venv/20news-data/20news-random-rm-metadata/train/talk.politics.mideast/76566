Oops...small mistake.  Thanks for mentioning it.  I just read on
the.Israel.line that a village just got shelled by terrorists last week 
and some children were killed.  I guess the terrorists must have gotten by
the security zone.  Just think at how much more shelling would be 
happening if the security zone weren't there.
