If you did not see with your 'eyes' freedom of religion you
must ne at least blind !
2 weeks ago I read the interview of a Turkish journalist in a GReek magazine,
he said nothing about being forbiden to have Turkish press in Greece !
Give as a brake. You call athnic cleansing of apopulation when it doubles?
What do you mean by that ? Anyway in Greece, as in every  country if you want
some property you 'inform' the goverment .
Well well well. When Turkish in Area of Komotini elect 1 out of 3
represenatives of this area to GReek parliament, if not freedom what is it?
3 out of 3 ? Maybe there are only Turks living there ....
I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which
were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen 
preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press.
