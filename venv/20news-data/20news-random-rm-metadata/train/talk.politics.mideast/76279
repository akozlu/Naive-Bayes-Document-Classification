What gives the US the right to keep New York?  It is the home of the
United Nations as well as being home to a myriad of ethnic groups.

(Actually, NYC is more comparable to the Gaza Strip; the controlling
authority would probably be pleased as punch to unload it on someone
else -- but no-one seems to want it!  :-)


A-historical bullshit.  Shamir fought the British (who, incidentally,
shipped whole shiploads of Jews back to the Nazis for extermination
and hung those Jewish fighters that they captured and didn't want to
deal with anymore).  Shamir did not attack civilians on airliners,
cruise ships, in airports, sports events, movie theaters, markets,
on buses and children in schoolyards.  Your comparison to a Master
Murderer like Abu Nidal is BLIND!
