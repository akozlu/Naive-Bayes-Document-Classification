So what are you?


I don't think that, you are just making noise.


That's true.  I try to learn from people who know more than me,
not from useless farts.


Of course, I have said that more times in this group than
anyone else, I'd think.


Quite true, that's why I am so careful in selecting quotes.


Oh bullshit.  Fanatic my bum.  Prove your blah or cork it.


How would you know what I consider?  Read my mind?


I looked very closely at a large number of sources.  You have no
idea what you are talking about.


That's true about the accounts of both Irgun and Arab propagandists.
Like Begin, for example.


No, I never got that feeling.  I got rather opposite feelings
about people like you, though.


Honesty?  Perhaps you would explain the testimony from members
of the Irgun, to be found in their own handwriting in the
Irgun Archives in Tel Aviv, that the wounded Arabs were killed,
that a group of 80 prisoners was massacred, that Lehi proposed
exterminating everybody at the pre-raid meeting.  Exactly what
reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected
in favour of Begin's?


This is very funny.  You carried on about unsupported evidence,
propagandists, axes to grind, and you end up telling us to stick
to the account of the leader of the alleged killers.  You are
obviously a hopeless case, as everyone can plainly see.
