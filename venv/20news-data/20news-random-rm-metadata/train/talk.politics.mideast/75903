 they are not treated as a second class citizens. That was my point.
 I fail to see how my words show discrimination. And what do you mean that

 nothing?


 I'm sorry, but I cannot see any logical order in the above argument.


 What part exactly is this one? The people cannot even sell their property
 if they want to leave Turkey.  The patriarch could not get a permision to
 renovate some buildings for decades; it needed a special agreement between
 the two goverments for this. Talk about a part of the society? Why has the
 size of the Greek community reduced to 1,500 old people and priests then?


 Yeah, you bet.


 You are far off from the reality.
