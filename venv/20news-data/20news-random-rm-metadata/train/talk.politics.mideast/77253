I would change one of the many parts that define my cultural identity.
If I loose a leg, it might change my personality, but I do not
stop being a human being. 
Even more, when someone gets a baboon heart, that person is still
human.


Not really. That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists.
As an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe that
there ever was one.
So, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lot
of ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people,
the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping
kosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a 
Torah that was inspired by god, etc. 
By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation
as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity.
For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural
identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a 
cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as
any other people in the world to have their own State. The same right
as the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have,
and as anybody else have.
I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all 
cultural identification.
