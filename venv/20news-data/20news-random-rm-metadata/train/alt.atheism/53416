No, that's the point of evolution, not the point of "natural
morality".   Unless, of course, as I have suggested several
times already, "natural morality" is just a renaming.


But your "yes?" is actually stronger than this.    You are
agreeing that "every time an organism evolves cooperative 
behaviour" you are going to call it a "natural morality."


Bee dance is a naturally developed piece of cooperative behaviour.
