Yes, atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership. Are you saying
that theists claim to not have self control? I don't think atheists are
"dominantly arrogant." They don't claim some god that has supremacy over
all of mankind. Now this claim would be arrogant, but atheists don't claim 
it. Most atheists do claim to own themselves. I think any disagreement with
this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant.
