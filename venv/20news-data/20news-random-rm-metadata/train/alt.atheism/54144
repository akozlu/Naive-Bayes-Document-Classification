Well, yes, but that belongs in the other group, there is a interpretation
found for everything. However, allowing any form of interpretation reduces
the information of the text so interprteted to zero.
 
By the way, I have checked the quote and I think the lines preceding those
quoted above are more interesting:
 
   21:32 where mountains are set on earth in order to immobilize the earth.
   21:33 where the skies (heavens?) are referred to as well supported.
 
the lines given above are  21:34 after my edition.
