No Cramer it does not.  In this instance you are telling porkies to
*yourself* as well as everyone else.  Haven't you ever been to a
cafe or restaurant and been absalutely stuffed full of goodies and yet
when one more item, just a little different, with a new texture and
a new taste, was presented you *somehow* found the space for it.

Maybe you haven't, so what?  It is a widely reported phenomina and
I reckon the same applies to sex.
