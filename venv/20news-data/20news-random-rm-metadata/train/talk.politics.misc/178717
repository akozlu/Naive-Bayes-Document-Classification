	What I saw on TV and what you claim are two different things. The
Davidians did not start shooting until after the BATF lobbed a couple
genades in the windows and started shooting themselves.


	EASY! If you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns
going in throught windows, that is a No-Knock warrant. Also since the 
videotape shows the BATF throwing grenades before the BD's etunred fire, 
you can safely assume that they didn't ring the doorbell.
