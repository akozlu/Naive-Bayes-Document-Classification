Here in Georgia, the state legislature in 1992 "accidentally passed a law 
lobbied for by Opthamologists prohibiting anyone but a licensed MD from
giving shots. They were trying to limit Optometrists from competing with
them.
They inadvertantly forbade nurses, EMTs, dentists, and tattoo artists 
from "piercing the skin." (probably diabetics too). The Secretary of State's 
office announced on June 30th that they wouldn't enforce it pending
reconsideration in the 1003 Legislature. In the hassle over the state flag
I heard nothing about repealing it.
