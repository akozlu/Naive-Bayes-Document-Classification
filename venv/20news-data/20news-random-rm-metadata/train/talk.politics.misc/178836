     Hey, *I* wasn't the one dancing and singing on Jan. 20, now
     WAS I?   I was roundly ridiculed for my "predictions".

     Sure they were easy.  TEll that to the other 43% of the people. :)




      Just WAIT until the see what Clinton has planned for 
      their pension funds!  :)  This one doesn't take much thinking
       either.    Uncle Sam needs money, BAD, and pension funds got it.

      Well, they USED to have it.  Turns out the states  have been
      plundering state employee funds for the past 2-3 years.  ;)
