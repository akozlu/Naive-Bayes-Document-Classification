Proving once again that Brett has a major thinking problem...

Two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the "medically an
needy" (those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical
care).  The typical elderly person spends 3.5 times what a person under age
65.  The typical medically needy person spends about 10 times what the
average person does.

You've got to adjust those data, Brett.
