Actually, Jerry Brown essentially did...and Clinton, in his demagogue
persona, condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year.

However....

Why don't the Republicans get their act together, and say they
will support a broad-based VAT that would have to be visible
(the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe)
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform, and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum.

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile...
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get
health care reform, and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
all in one fell swoop.
