How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure.  I am the first
to state that the 10% figure may be too high- but it may just be too low,
depending on what you are talking about.

Keep in mind that there are 'practicing' heterosexuals that are actually
gay.  These people chose to take a road that avoids being harassed and
they wanted to 'fit-in' with everyone other 'normal' person.

But let's get off of this irrational behavior of calling everyone a liar,
you cannot even start to support such claims.


This sure sounds definitive.  How do you label Kinsey's work like this,
from that factually based and scientific journal WSJ?
