What evidence are you aware of. What was reported in the media, or all of
the evidence that was presented at the trial.

This sounds to me a lot like the first Rodney King 5 trial. A bunch of people
who saw 10 to 15 seconds out of a several minute long video, decided that
they knew more than people who had sat through a two week trial.
