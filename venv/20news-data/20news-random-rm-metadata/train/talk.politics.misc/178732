At all times in human history, people have killed and stolen from one
another.  If you can find an example of where this hasn't happened in
history, then you have discovered a new phenomenon in nature.

It is pointless asking whether people "should" do this;
they DO do this.  It has just evolved that way.  Humans have evolved to
have this characteristivc.  You can debate whether this should be
particular matter should be left up to the individual or not, but it is
the nature of humans to kill and steal from others and you will not find
a single counterexample (of a society without these types) in nature.

Please find a better argument than that's the way it has always been.
Child mortality has always been, yet we find it in our hearts to have
made an attempt to change that.
