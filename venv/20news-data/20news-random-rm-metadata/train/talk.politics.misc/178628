That probably is not true.  But today it may not be much better for
the gay population in general.


Where are all of these studies?  You have cited a few, and my research
shows that there are not that many.  Do Not Confuse a survey as a
study, there is a big difference.  Asking people outside of a polling
booth and adding up numbers is NOT a study.


But this is what you base most of your conclusion upon. Warm
fuzzy feelings.

Maybe he has stated an educated opinion based upon the studies
that involve genetics and psychological influence.  There are a
lot of those types of studies, aren't there?  Try reading some.

This is a crap statement and comparison.  Many people use this sad
and stupid argument.  There is not relationship between alcoholics
and people's sexual orientation- except that some may find what it
really is when they are drunk (repressed inhibition released).

Nonsense- this simply is not true.  I suppose it is a waste of time
to try and tell you to understand what a study presents.  Most of
what you cite does not extrapolate anything, you do.


If people in general would stop using irrational position to oppress
other's and leave our private lives to ourselves, I would have no
support for laws and rules to protect people form this.  But we need
only look at post such as yours to see that they lack rational
thought and intelligent outlooks.
