    Larry King Live was both telling and sickening.  Every other word
    out of Janet REno's mouth  was "the little children" ,etc.  Sounded
    like Clinton talking.  She made claims that the children were 
    beaten, etc, DESPITE the pronouncements of social workers that none
    of the children who left the compound were abused.  But the REAL
    crime:


      Larry King, and his censored show.  NOT ONE FUCKING QUESTION
      about Reno's possible error.  Just two calls about how she
      had made a "good decision".  Now, it doesn't take a rocket
      scientist to figure out that SOME people are going to be upset.
