The federal civil rights trial against the four LA police
officers accused of violating Rodney King's civil rights is
now history:

  Lawrence Powell:	guilty
  Stacey Coons:		guilty
  Theodore Brazenio:	innocent
  Timothy Wind:		innocent

  Sentencing slated for mid August, appeals expected.

  So far, all is calm in LA...
