 Now which is it?  Are you going to comdemn national media, then turn around
 and use it to support some position you present?  Seems somewhat contradictory
 doesn't it.

I believe this true when we speak of physical data, in the
sense of pure science.  But when we speak of data that revolve
around social sciences then we have to be careful.


I quite agree.  But these are cases or 'news events' that contain
politics, social science information, sociology, etc.  and at
best are reflections of the group that reports them.

As you have pointed out, it is difficult to report that the
temperature was 98 degrees when it was 60 degrees and have
people believe you.


Yes and no.  The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer,
a value called the median- which one used this makes us 
believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and
1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners.  Homosexuals
are purported to make up only 1%.  In this case, the majority
of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual.

It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.
But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramer
claims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity.

 Very good- this is a point that I have tried to bring out,
and as any network news program will show you, it is true.

The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because
of where its loyalties lie.
