The only time I have heard mention of such a mechanism is
with respect to FEMALE homosexuality resulting from HETEROSEXUAL
childhood abuse.
(and this as only one of several factors affecting the same person)

As Mr Cramer appears to concentrate on MALE homosexuality
I doubt this is what he has in mind.
