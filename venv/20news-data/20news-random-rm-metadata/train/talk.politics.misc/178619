This is getting sad.  All you can do is make this ridiculous statements,
based upon some old information and a Press Democrat article that was
poorly written.

Please show the numbers for your use of "MUCH more".  I have not seen
them.  And I want them to be true and accurate, or at least show a 
trend within the everyday gay population.

There are all kinds of 'damaged and screwed up' people, and most of
them are not gay.
