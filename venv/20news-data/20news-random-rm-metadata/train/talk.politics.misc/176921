Wasn't the beef with the English over "taxation WITHOUT REPRESENTATION",
not taxation itself?  

From my admittedly dim recollection of US history, most of the problems 
we Americans have had with taxes have been with unfair/unjust taxation
schemes, not with taxes themselves.  It's pretty hard to run a government
without any means of support.
