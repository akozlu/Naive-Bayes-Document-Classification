What is "SO" supposed to signify?  I prefer the companionship of a
person, not a euphemism.


Thankfully, you got the gender right.  For I am not a deviant.


Sexual deviants do not comprise a "political minorit[y]".


I only associate with girls who do indeed have self-respect.  But were
I to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the
door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
"homosexuality", I would encourage her to indeed do so, and I would
further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
the way out.  Who needs such an airhead?



Oh, I can't do anything _BUT_ count on it.  After all, it is
inevitable, for it is part of the natural order of things.  Throughout
history, nature has always asserted itself.  Don't be so arrogant as
to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the
nature of man where practically every other generation has failed.
Greater men than you haven't been able to do this.  The above _MOST_
_CERTAINLY_ _WILL_ happen, no matter how much you may wish to pretend
otherwise.

Moreover, I'm not your "sweetheart".
