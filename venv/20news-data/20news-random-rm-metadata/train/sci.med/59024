I was under the (possibly incorrect) assumption that most of the MSG on
our foods was made from processing sugar beets. Is this not true? Are 
there other sources of MSG?

I am one of those folx who react, sometimes strongly, to MSG. However,
I also react strongly to sodium chloride (table salt) in excess. Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat
and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest, upper left quadrant.
