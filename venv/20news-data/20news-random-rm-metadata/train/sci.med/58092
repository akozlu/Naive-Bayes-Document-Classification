30mg per day of propranolol is a homeopathic dose in migraine. 
If you got fatigued at that level, it is unlikely that you will
tolerate enough beta blocker to help you.  

Probably a single nightime dose.  We don't know how they work in migraine, but
it probably has something to do with seratonin.
