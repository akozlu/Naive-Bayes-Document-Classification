=>Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
=>the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part of
=>the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You
=>see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't
=>nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
=>photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
=>conducts electricity.  Surprise, surprise!

=	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were 
=	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
=	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'

You can also replicate the effect with a rock:  Take your first Kirlian
photograph.  Then moisten one edge of the rock.  Lo! and behold!  Phantom rock!
