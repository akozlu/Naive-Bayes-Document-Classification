I'm not sure about that.  Did you see the "poll" they took that showed
that most people thought physicians should be paid $80,000 per year
tops?  That's all I make, but I doubt that most physicians are going
to work very hard for that kind of bread.  Many wouldn't be able
to service their med school debts on that.  Mike Royko had a good
column about it.
