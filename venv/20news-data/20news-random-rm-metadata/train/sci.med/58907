There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill.
That's the point, after all.


That's because these "peer-reviewed" studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models.
You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument
with a statement like "noting that animal administration has pro-
duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its
use in humans."  This is precisely NOT what you said.


It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of
glutamate involve more than "food science".


So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with
the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to
Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.


Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a
essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood.


Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of
glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this "projected safety
margin" is a construct derived from animal models and given that,
you can "prove" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in
infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.


You mean "asserting".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just
plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious
reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon
of the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.


Probably one of the dumber remarks you've made.
