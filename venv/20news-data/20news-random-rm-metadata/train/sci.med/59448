Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complications
from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery.
The risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large,
hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia. 
Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction.
And the smaller the hernia is, the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will
become incarcerated or strangulated.
