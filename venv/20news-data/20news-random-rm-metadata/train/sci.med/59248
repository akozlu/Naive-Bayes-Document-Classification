Secaris is reasonably inexpensive ($6.00 Cdn for a tube), and is indeed an
over the counter medication. Why it does not appear to be available in the
US, I don't know. It's manufactured in Montreal.

It's a nasal lubricant, and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from
dry mucous membranes.

From some of the replies to my original posting, it's evident that some
people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
from environmental influences (ie, dry air). But I've had no responses
from anyone with experience with Rutin. Is there another newsgroup that
might have specifics on herbal remedies?

But thanks to all those who did reply with their experiences.
