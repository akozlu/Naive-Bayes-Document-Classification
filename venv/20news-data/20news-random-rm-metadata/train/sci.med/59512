First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  This is sci.med, not
alt.sex.

Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that "American's are just too hung
up on the penis....blah,blah".  I think most American's don't care about
anything so comlicated as that.  They just think it "looks nicer".  Ask 
a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is
easier to clean.  Still others do it because "Daddy was".

Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality.
