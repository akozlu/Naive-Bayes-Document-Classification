	My blood pressure soars, my heart pounds, and I can't get to sleep
for the life of me... feels about like I just drank 8 cups of coffee.

whatever other names it may go under. Basicaly I read the ingredients, and
if I don't know what they all are, I don't buy the product.

	MSG sensitivity is definately *real*.
