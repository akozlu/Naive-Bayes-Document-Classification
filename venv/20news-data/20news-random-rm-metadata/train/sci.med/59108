One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training
are ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In order
to get the green card they have to return to their country and
apply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around
this problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town
with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks
a rider onto a bill saying "Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent
residency in the US."  A lot of bills in congress have such riders
attached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although
now they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US
citizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines, or
whereever.
