Wow, the WWII channel did something not-WWII?


The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie 
audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more 
realistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are 
still out of range, but not impossible.


SF (and I"ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and 
sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.


I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films, but that isn't 
saying a whole lot.
