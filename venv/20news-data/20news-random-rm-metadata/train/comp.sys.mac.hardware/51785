Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at
least three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610. They have not, to
my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could
make one, technologically.

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs.

Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS
adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted,
there are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a
NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an
LC/LCII/LCIII anyway.
