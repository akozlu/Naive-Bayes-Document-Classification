this is a bad idea. my machine is on 24 hours a day, but it's actually 
_doing_ things 24 hours a day. i use it as an all purpose alarm clock, 
scheduler, i've got routines that run in the middle of the night, phone 
calls it makes during the day when i'm out. if your machine is _on_ 24 hours 
a day, then you can count on it to be _working_ 24 hours a day. i could call 
it from work and download a file that i might need, i could call it from 
work and have it turn the lights on if i'm going to be late (oops, more 
wasted electricity -- but conversely, i could have it turn the lights 
_off_). heck, i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have dinner 
ready when i get there.
