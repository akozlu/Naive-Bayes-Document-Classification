I believe the FPU on the LCIII is always supposed to go on the logic
board, not in the PDS board. I have heard of crashing problems with
PDS-based FPUs on the LCIII. Asante may have fixed them but why
bother. Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway? The
extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. I say FPU on
main logic board, in socket, Ethernet alone on PDS card, in slot.
