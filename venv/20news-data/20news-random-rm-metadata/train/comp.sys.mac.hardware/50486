    You must not have tried very hard. I just opend mine in about 2
seconds. Take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open
much like the older ADB mouses used to have. It's a bit harder to turn
at first but it is quite simple to open.


    Well, if you don't match up the pins correctly you will have some
problems. A close look at the socket should give you an idea of the
proper orientation of the chip.
