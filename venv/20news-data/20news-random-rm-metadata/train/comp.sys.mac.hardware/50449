I have a friend who has a MAC (LC or LC II I think), and her family has an
"extra" LaserJet IIIp sitting around. Is there any way to connect these
two and make them work without a postscript cartridge?  She told me that a
random friend of hers had mentioned something about some software package
that could do the translation...
