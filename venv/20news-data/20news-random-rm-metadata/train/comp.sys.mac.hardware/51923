  A 256K DRAM chip is a 256 kilobit chip whereas a 256K SIMM is a 256
kilobyte memory module. The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge
and on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256
KBytes.

Apple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or
special memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what
kind of chips you need.
