			  While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive, I have seen
a part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it
through which you insert the CD). The document (which I got from the
2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel
kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650.
The external unit may be a better deal after all.
