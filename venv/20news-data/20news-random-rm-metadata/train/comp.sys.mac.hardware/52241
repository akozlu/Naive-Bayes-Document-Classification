    This is something I asked before, but I don't think I got an answer, or
maybe I lost the answer, or maybe it's just an obvious question (:->). Will 
the GX stuff (on-line docs etc.) be available on the DEVELOP CDs, or will it 
only go out to people in the Developer's program and such? Just curious.
