Benchmarks are for marketing dweebs and CPU envy.  OK, if it will make
you happy, the 486 is faster than the 040.  BFD.  Both architectures
are nearing then end of their lifetimes.  And especially with the x86
architecture: good riddance.


The point being the processor speed is only one of many aspects of a
computers performance.  Clock speed, processor, memory speed, CPU
architecture, I/O systems, even the application program all contribute 
to the overall system performance.


Look them up yourself.
