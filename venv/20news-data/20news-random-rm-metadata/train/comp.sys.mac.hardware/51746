Not quite. 66MHz Pentium - 65 SPECint92, 57 SPECfp92 .
	   66MHz MC98601 - 50 SPECint92, 80 SPECfp92 .

Note that SPECint is more important for most real world applications.


As far as the 486DX2-66 goes - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 .



Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola "equivalents"
although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
is something that is highly debatable.
