Well, I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed:

	One "socket" for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One "socket" for a 72-pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flat-pack FPU

	A processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit
	data path that the LC/LC II lacked

That's it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS, but that's the only place.
