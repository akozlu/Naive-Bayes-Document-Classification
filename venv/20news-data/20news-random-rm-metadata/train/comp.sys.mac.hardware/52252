-- 
I would like to find out about the ADB connector on the back of the
macintosh powerbooks.    

	After seeing several products that use it for powering devices
	on the powerbook I also thought up of something to power from
	the ADB connector (the keyboard/mouse connector)
	Does anyone have spex on it....  I know it has voltage on it
	and a serial i/o of some sort if some kind soul could tell
	me the way you talk to the mac through it (ie packet info)
	IT would BE APPRECIATED GREATLY!!!!!

	on a second note,   What are the pin outs of the 
	MAC powerbook  modem connector ..   I have would like to
	know which pins are +5V, data  ETC...  

		AGAIN THANKS!
