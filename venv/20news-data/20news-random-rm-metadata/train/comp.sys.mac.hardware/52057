As a side note, in that same ad (MacWorld 6/93), they are selling the 50MHz
Powercache for the IIsi with FPU for $575. For those thinking of upgrading
to the 040 33 MHz Turbo (an upgrade costs $600 direct from Daystar), this comes
out to $1175, about $200 cheaper than what most mail-order companies charge.
