Actually, the 295 is for the 33 MHz PowerCard, not the Universal Powercache.
The 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about
$500 (still not a bad deal).  I believe the Powercard is one generation 
older than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that
the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many
Macs with the proper adaptor.  Both cards are 68030 based.

I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise 
different from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).

I would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these
Powercards were going very fast.
