All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
Mac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumed
the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying "This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware"
even though there was no cartridge in the drive.
