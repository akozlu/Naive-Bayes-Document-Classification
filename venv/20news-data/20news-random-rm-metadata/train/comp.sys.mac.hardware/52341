Well, almost NuBUS 90 anyway, comprehensive bus contention between processors
is not supported in the current Macintoshes, could be wrong?

However, I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself,
don't ask, Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard.

Very interesting possibilities indeed!
