Huh?  If I buy a 128M optical, I might lose my friends?  Why - do they
smell bad?

:-)



On a serious note, I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures.  But I
am curious about Jon's comments on cartridge wear for the the Bernoullis.
Can someone elaborate?  Is there a general consensus that the 128M opticals
are the most reliable?  I am mostly concerned about media failures, as
opposed to drive mechanism failures.
