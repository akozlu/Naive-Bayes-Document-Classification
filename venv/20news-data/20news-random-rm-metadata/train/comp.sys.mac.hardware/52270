My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have
noticed.  FastBack II backup utility does not work!!!  The strange thing
is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
works with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and
not hardware related.
