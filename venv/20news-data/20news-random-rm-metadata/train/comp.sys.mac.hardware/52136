Well, I don't exaclty know what _should_ be done, but what I do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use.  I do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though.  Turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less RAM than
a screen saver (but it requires more of MY memory to remember to turn
it off... pretty easy to remember to turn it on though :-)
