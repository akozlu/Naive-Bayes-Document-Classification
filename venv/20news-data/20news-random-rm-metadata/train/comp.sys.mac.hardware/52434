I too had a very unpleasant experience with "Hardware That's Shi*". It
featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who
was totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties I
had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their
house brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of
junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of
electronics.

I shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me
something over $200 for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes
and duties and lost time.
