Could anyone direct me to the FTP site where I can find the DOS-based
morphing package called DMORF12.ZIP?  I had downloaded this file last week,
but the new DOS 6 crashed my hard drive and I lost it. Now I can't find the
site where I got it from.......

Also, are there any other morphing packages out for DOS (freeware or shareware)


Thanks in advance,
Barry
