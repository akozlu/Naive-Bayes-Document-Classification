Or perhaps you write a freely available, GPLed unix for commonly
available computer platforms (i386/i486 machines) and become a catalyst
for a major netwide project which produces a better unix-like os than
many commercial counterparts (see comp.os.linux for details).  Or maybe
you found a Legue for Programming Freedom to fight restrictive litigation
and software patenting practices, thereby protecting the creative freedom
so vital to continuing progress in our field.  Or maybe you start up
a gnu project, and produce by far and away the best c/c++ compiler
for unix there is, not to mention other valuable utilities.

Some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
ideals.  As for Bill Gates, after pawning of grossly inferior software
onto the PC market for ten years, if he ever was a hacker, he deserves
to have his name eradicated from the Annals of Computer Hackery.

As for me, I like running linux+X+countless other packages, without
paying a dime.  On the other hand, I have no problem purchasing motif
or other good software, as long as Microsoft hasn't fouled it with their
inept input.

My 2 cents worth, flames will be patiently ignored. :-)

Jean.
