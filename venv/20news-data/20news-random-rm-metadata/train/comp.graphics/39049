O

I also would like code or algorithms to do this.

In fact, I am interested in sources for code and/or algorithms that
convert 2D graphical objects into other 2D graphical objects that
will render into the same image. i.e. Bezier curves to B splines,
or splines to circular arc segments, or B splines to polgons, etc...
