 Are you using the traditional radiosity method, progressive refinement, or
  something else in your package?

 If you need to project patches on the hemi-cube surfaces, what technique are
  you using?  Do you have hardware to facilitate the projection?




  What are the guest username and password for this ftp site?




   Thanks, Stephan.
