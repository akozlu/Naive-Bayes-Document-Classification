I was at an Adobe seminar/conference/propaganda forum/whatever-you-want-to-
call-it a couple months ago where they announced that Display Postscript was
going to be included in the next release of Sun's OS, (presumably Solaris.)
Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this,
Adobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun.  Other than the
articles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after, I haven't
heard a peep about it.  I hope it's still in the works.
