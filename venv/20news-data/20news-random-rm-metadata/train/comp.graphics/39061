Maybe. I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine. The only problem it
has (and ever has had) is the "arm" of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it
round a bit. But other than that, it's been perfect! So what's that,
about um, 60 months???!
