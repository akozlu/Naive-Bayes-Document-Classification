Robert MacElwaine sez (again!);


OK, I got it.  Actually, these message of MacElwaine's are coded messages.
Read only the caps, and it all comes clear!:



Maybe it's a message telling us what actually happened to the legendary
Larson.  Perhaps it's a warning that one should not expend too much
effort trying to counter MacElwaine's postings.  Who can be sure? :-)
