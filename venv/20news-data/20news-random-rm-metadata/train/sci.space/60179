Unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?)
for a while.  While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas, they never
got much money.  I've heard good things about Griffin, but it's hard to want
him back in a job where he couldn't do anything.


The group examining the Freedom-based space station redesign proposals is 
headed by Michael Griffin, "NASA's cheif engineer" in the words of Space News.
I believe this is him.
