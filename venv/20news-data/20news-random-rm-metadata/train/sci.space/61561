Well, no, during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was
not opened until after the Shuttle had landed.  

I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter
with the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination
worries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to 
keep clean.

But I still don't know where the idea is coming from that HST _NEEDS_ a
re-boost.  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them.  There
is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in
December.
