I am familiar with the project.  It is the Onboard Shuttle Flight
Software Project.  This software controls the Space Shuttle During
all dynamic phases as well as on-orbit.
It has ultra-high reliability and extremely
low error rates.  There have been several papers published on the
subject and I'll collect some references.  There may be an
article in the IBM Systems Journal Late '93, early '94.

There is no magic formula.  We did it with dedicated and disciplined
folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors
and is corrected based on errors that "escape".  We present a
one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks.
The next one is May 19th in Washington, D.C.  I can fax specifics
to those who are interested.
