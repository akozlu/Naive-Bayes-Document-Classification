I don't think that idea means what you think it does. Having everyone
on Earth subject to some ad agency's "poor taste" *is* an abomination.
(abomination : n. loathing; odious or degrading habit or act; an
object of disgust. (Oxford Concise Dictionary)) Maybe *you* don't mind
having every part of your life saturated with commercials, but many of
us loathe it. I'd rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred
by a giant billboard, and I'll bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious
to an astronomer like Sagan.
