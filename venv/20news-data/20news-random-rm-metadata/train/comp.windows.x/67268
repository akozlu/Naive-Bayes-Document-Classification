: Solaris 2.x machine using rlogin; now do an "ls" and get the first
: character of each line display in the last column of the display
: with the rest of the line wrapped to the next line of the display.

: Log out and the condition persists.  Check stty all, try reset
: with no effect.

The condition happens  when the TAB is not  set  to 8 spaces,  set and
then check out.
