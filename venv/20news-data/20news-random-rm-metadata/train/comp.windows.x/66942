Could some one please send me (or tell me where to ftp from) the patches required
 for xrolo so that  I can compile-in the SPARCStation phone-dialing feature?

I am using SunOS  4.1.1, and therefore don't have "multimedia/libaudio.h" or 
"multimedia/audio_device.h" and associated functions.

Just in case, our mail gateway only accepts msgs < 45Kb.

Thanks in advance,
Shash.
