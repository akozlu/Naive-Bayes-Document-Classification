Hi,

I am programming in XView, SunOS 4.1.2 & OpenWindows 3.0. I would like
to rotate some text and display it. I did read the FAQ in comp.windows.x
but am not sure how do I translate it to XView. I would appreciate if
someone can give me tips on how to do it. Thanx.

PS : As I am not a frequent news group reader, I would appreciate if
     answers/replies would be mailed to me. I will post a follow-up.
