I have heard of two packages for the PC that support X-Win.
The first is Linux which is a free Unix Package.  The Second
is X-Appeal, which sounds pretty good.  It can be found at
 garbo.uwusa.fi in the ~ftp/pc/demo/ dir.  The files are

	xap13exe.zip
	xap10fon.zip
	drivers.zip

This should get you started.
