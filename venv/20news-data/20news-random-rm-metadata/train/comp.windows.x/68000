May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...)

DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard
X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft
Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing
you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine
on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display
on the net).

Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform;
many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or
no modifications. (Often, you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group
comp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com,
and I'd be happy to fill you in.
