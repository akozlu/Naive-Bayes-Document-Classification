Wasn't the shareware fee a "suggestion" by John?
Is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
honour it and part with money.  Personally if I was in his position I would
do exactly the same thing, John has obviously put in lot of time and effort
into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.

Just my pennies worth

(Keep up the good work John)
