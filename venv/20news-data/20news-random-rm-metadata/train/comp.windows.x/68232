I was wondering this myself.





Unfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows
conference.  Perhaps some good will come of it, but the two are so dissimilar
and the NT marketing stuff is so large in the Xhibition adds that I was 
coming to a similar conclusion as Jesse...
