Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu (4.2.3 Positioning the SimpleMenu).
The reference is to the R5 documentation.

I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget. Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on. The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and
MenuPopup actions.


Ari.wcChildren:		app

*app.wcCreate:		Command
*app.wcPopups:		menu
*app.translations:	#override \n\
			<Btn3Down>: XawPositionSimpleMenu(menu) MenuPopup(menu)

*menu.wcCreate:		SimpleMenu
*menu.wcChildren:	one, two, three

*one.wcCreate:		SmeBSB

*two.wcCreate:		SmeBSB

*three.wcCreate:	SmeBSB
