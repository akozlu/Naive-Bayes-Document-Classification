Have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to 
something other than 0 and 1?  The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.



Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  You could
have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)
might all be the same value?




If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,
don't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill.  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles.


Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics
don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle?
