We are currently evaluating GUI builders, initially for Motif but with
a wish to be flexible & portable.  We have been through the popular
names (UIMX, TeleUSE, XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what
we have seen of Galaxy from Visix.  I have spoken to current users
from a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect), and
seen favourable comments on the net.  However, since it is fairly
expensive to get an evaluation license from Visix, I would like to
query the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy.  Did anybody
evaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or
find any mis-features ?

advTHANKSance,

Phil
