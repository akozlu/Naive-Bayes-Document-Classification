Thanks for docs info. It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And
VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....
