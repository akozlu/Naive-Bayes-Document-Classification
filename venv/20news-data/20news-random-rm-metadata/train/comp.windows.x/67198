Well, after massaging the Dec.cf, osf.def, (can't remember the exact names)
from OSF into my normal X11R5 distribution, everything compiles and links
fine, but xterm doesn't run.


Warning: Representation size 8 must match superclass's to override background
Warning: translation table syntax error: Modifier or '<' expected
Warning: ... found while parsing 'p^#j?;'P)=#'
X Error of failed request:  BadColor (invalid Colormap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  85 (X_AllocNamedColor)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  18
  Current serial number in output stream:  18

Other than this, all the other core X stuff seems to be working OK.  Any
hints/tips appreciated, patches would be primo.

Thanks.
