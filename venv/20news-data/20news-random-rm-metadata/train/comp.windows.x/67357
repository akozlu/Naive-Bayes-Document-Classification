I've used X11R5 with classics set for both 1024x768 and 1152x900 (you
can choose which resolution you want in the PROM monitor before
booting).  One person had trouble with X11R5 that was fixed by
using the multi-screen version.  Here's how our version was built.
(You can just copy /usr/local/X11R5/bin/Xsun from farside.rutgers.edu
if you just want to see whether this version will work.)
