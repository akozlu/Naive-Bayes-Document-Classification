I`ve been happy with aXe under Linux. Now I wanted to use it under HP-UX,
too. However, my attempts have ended in core dumps this far (Bus Error).

Has anybody else been more successful? Jim Wight`s INSTALL file does
say there have been problems with HP`s...

Data: aXe 5.0; HP-UX 9.01; X11R4 or X11R5 doesn`t seem to matter (shared
libs); HP 9000/720.

Thanks in advance,
