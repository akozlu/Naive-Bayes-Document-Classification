I've seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any
guarantee. On the other hand, I've heard that some people use them
with success, although I have yet to communicate directly with such a
person. Have you tried one? What was your experience? How did you use
it (occasional charging, long-term leave-it-for-weeks, etc.)?
