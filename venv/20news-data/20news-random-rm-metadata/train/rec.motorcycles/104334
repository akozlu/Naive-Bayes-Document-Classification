 Currently there are no "Velcro" jump boots as issue in
the military, there are two other kinds. One is made my
Cochran and sell for $85.00 in either the Clothing sales
store or US Cavalry (Price match at the Cav store) the
second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design.
Actually they don't care what you wear as long is they
are 10 eyelets high.
There is another boot called a "Tankers boot" this has
similar construction to a wellington boot except for the
boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness.
Nice boots
