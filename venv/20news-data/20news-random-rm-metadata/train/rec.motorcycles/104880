Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order.  The were 
aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the 
grip itself.  Wires ran outside of the bars, from the grips to a switch and 
finaly the battery.  Cycle Magazine tested them YEARS ago and liked them.  
Dunno if they are still made.  Might check with the snowmobile racers.
