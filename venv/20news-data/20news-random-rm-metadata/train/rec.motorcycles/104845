C'mon Ed.........

a)  All things have their weak areas
b)  What's IR....Idiot Response......Dogs have more Rods or Cones (I'm not sure
    which?) than humans and this allows their eyes to collect more light in lower
    light conditions. Consequently their colour vision is almost non-existant. I
    mean, if dogs had built in infra-red vision, the armed forces would be
    strapping them to missiles instead of paying a quarter million for IR guidance
    capabilities.
c)  My dog has net access ! !
