I first heard it about academic politics but the same thought seems to
apply to the BMWMOA

"The politics is so dirty because the stakes are so small."

Who cares? I get my dues-worth from the ads and occasional technical
articles in the "News". I skip the generally drab articles about someone's
trek across Iowa. If some folks get thrilled by the power of the BMWMOA,
they deserve whatever thrills their sad lives provide.

BTW, I voted for new blood just to keep things stirred up.
