Dear Gillian

That is such a wickedly cool idea; why didn't I think of it??? However, here
in Canada the aerials (antenna) are usually near the driver or passenger areas
and I would surely be seen......but I'll give it a try anyway.

Thanks for the first truely useable piece of information I have heard in a long
time (and you are by no means a mere female, as this way at getting back takes
real guts to do).
