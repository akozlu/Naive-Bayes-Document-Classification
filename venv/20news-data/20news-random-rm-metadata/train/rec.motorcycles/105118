Me too. Even after I bought the 3-piece Krauser K2 set.  Now and then, 
DK puts them on sale for 50 bux or so to clear out inventory, but they
never seem to to go away.  They are the Volkswagens of tank bags, I guess.

BTW, the late Paul O' Neill showed me a trick with a pair of pliers that
will extend their life considerably.  When the zipper starts to separate
behind the pull (because of age and wear), squash the pull body with the
pliers just a bit to tighten it back up.  I would have tossed my bag three 
years ago, but this fixed it up and kept it secure and reliable.
