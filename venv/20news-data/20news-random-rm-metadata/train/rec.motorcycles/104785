Oh horse puckey.  Without their cop partner in attendance, they are less likely
to be controllable *without* the use of force which would kill the dog.


O.k.  so you've disabled the dog's mouth, and given up use of your arm to do
so.  How `bout them front and read paws, and the fact that to plug up that 
mouth you've given the dog the advantage of balance...


Have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of 
hardened instruments such as a baseball bat?  Without the use of both arms and
full cooperation of the beastie involved, it's not *that* easy.  Oh, but wait,
you've got your arm shoved in the dogs mouth.  You lose....


Oh *now* you qualify you earlier statement by saying a *trained* human.  


Most people here have not been trained to deal with a dog that wants to maul
you.  get a clue.
