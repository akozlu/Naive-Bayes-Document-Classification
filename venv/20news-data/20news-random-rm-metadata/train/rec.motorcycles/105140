	I'm not sure how far standardisation went, but on two of my bikes (the
GS550B and, I think, the GT380M) I was able to pop a Cibie' insert directly
into the original housing (held in by those roughly W-shaped springs).  The
inserts used 55/60W halogen bulbs, and were great, although Mr Bill later
indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system.
