Um, you gotta understand these "salesdroids" as you call them.  They look at
it this way: burn lotsa tire; make lotsa money.  I'm sure s/ he knew how
stupid the "HG" was.  Would you seriously stop them from burning off 
a seasons worth of tire??  The SQUIDS probably would buy Metzelers or some
good low profile tire anyhow...

Yep.  Them droids sure a sneaky bastards! ;)
