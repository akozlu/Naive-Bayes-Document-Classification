Yeah, really, no shit!

Like that jerk Loch Faircloth that couldn't win an election
as a democrat so he switches to republican the year before this
past election and takes Terry Sanford out with his bitch
and moan campaigning typical of NC senate/house/gubner races.

I swear, I'd kick Jesse Helms in the head if I ever got the chance.

Maybe then he'd get a fucking clue as to how the rest of
the world lives.
