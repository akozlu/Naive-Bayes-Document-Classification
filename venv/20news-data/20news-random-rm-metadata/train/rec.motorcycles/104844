One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
his megabuck/micromass bike. He said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel. The dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he
fled quite rapidly. Then again, he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp, so I don't think I'd care to try this one on a motorcycle.


That's almost unfair, I've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)
