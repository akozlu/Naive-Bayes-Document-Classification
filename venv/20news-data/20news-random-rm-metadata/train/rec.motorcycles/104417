I don't think this is the case, at least not on all jetskis.  On my
friend's jetski, bars turn left to go left.  Anyway, all you're doing
there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between
the handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary
(simple linkage could make it work either way).


It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion
than snow skis.  But it *has* been an amusing digression.

Hey Ed, how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins
left to go left?  :-)  Or am I confusing two threads here?
