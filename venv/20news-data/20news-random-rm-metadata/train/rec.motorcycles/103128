}first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),
}but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,

As someone who was told quite firmly by 2 Honda sales/service weenies
that there is no larger tank available for the Hawk (I have a '91
Hawk with the puny 3.2 gal tank), I'd be very interested to know if
there is any decent aftermarket solution. I'd love to have at least
a 4 gal tank.
