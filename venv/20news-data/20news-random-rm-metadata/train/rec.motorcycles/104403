 
 If a large Malmute counts then yes someone has heard(and seen) such
an irresponsible childish stunt. The dog needed assistance straightening
out once on board. The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw
them over the driver/pilots shoulders. Said dog would get shit eating
grin on its face and away they'd go. The dogs ass was firmly planted
on the seat.
 
 My dog and this dog actively seek each other out at camping party's.
They hate each other. I think it's something personal.
