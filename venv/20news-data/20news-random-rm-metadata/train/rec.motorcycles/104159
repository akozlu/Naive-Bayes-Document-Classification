Personally, I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree
burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns
that he suffered in "the joke".  Granted I was one of those people that were
taken in by it and I was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for 
pulling such a thing (which I made known to him).

But then again, for an April Fool "joke" I would also go on record as saying
that it was the best orchestrated one I've ever seen and it certainly sucked
a LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-)...

"sick" - "twisted"??? Who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing?

I tip my twisted lid to thee Jeffy 8-).
