If your distance calc is correct for an "on the road distance" (and not
as the crow flies), this is 900km a day for 5 days.  If you spend the
entire time on interstates, which would be a total waste of time, that's
at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating/peeing/
sight-seeing etc.

I was contemplating a similar trip, but from Ottawa to LA, or
maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx.  

I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it, I'd
have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of
time enjoying the country around me; i.e. stopping with a camera,
meeting towns-people, going to a few bars.  No sense spending 2 weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump.

I estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.


In question 8:)


Try and stay off the interstates!!!


Depending on your route and my plans, I may be heading that way as far
as at least Detroit.
