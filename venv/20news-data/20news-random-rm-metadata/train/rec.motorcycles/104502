Ya, Fat Chance.  The "offending" rider was a moto journalist.  Those
guys can sell hundreds of bikes with one stroke of the pen and
as such get away with murder when it comes to test bikes.

One way or the other, it was probably worth the early expiration of 
one mufler to see a bone head get his butt baked.
