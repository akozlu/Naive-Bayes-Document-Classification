Hell, just save your candle stubs and bring them.  Light them up, and
dribble the wax all over the kindling wood and light _that_.  Although
I like the belly-button lint / eggshell case idea the best, if you're
feeling particularly industrious some eventful evening.  Or you can
do what I did one soggy summer: open the fuel line, drain some onto a 
piece of rough or rotten wood, stick that into the middle of the soon-to-
be inferno and CAREFULLY strike a match... As Kurt Vonnegut titled one
of the latter chapters in Cat's Cradle, "Ah-Whoom!"

Works like a charm every time :-)
