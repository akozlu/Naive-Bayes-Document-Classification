Hmmmm I noticed sometime ago that I could do the same on my Virago, and
since I don't read many schematics, I didn't really think aobut it too
much.   Yes it does provide excellent coverage, but I figured it would
probably draw a little too much current.  I also figured that it was 
overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight.  Are you saying 
that these switches are designed for the hi/lo combination?
