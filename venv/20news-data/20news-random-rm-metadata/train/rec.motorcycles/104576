	Professionals who train guard dogs, when polled, gave themselves a
1 in 4 chance of survival tackling a trained dog unarmed.  A trained guard
dog is not to be trifled with.  An untrained mutt may be another story.

ObMoto:  A local dog used to chase me all the time.  Really annoying.  I 
finally started stopping every time he'd chase me.  He didn't know what to do
then and would usually just slink off the road.  After a couple weeks of this
he stopped chasing me altogether.  He would still chase cars or other bikes,
though.  I think he recognized me when I went by ;-).
