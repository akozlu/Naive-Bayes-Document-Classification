No wonder bikers have such a horrid reputation.

Go find a HUMAN!



I agree completely. Unfortunately, the majority
of my feelings, before I can even start to think
rationally abhout the dog that is trying to kill
me, are fear.

When there's been a moment to set up, like you
said "a bit down the road" or whatever, I've 
never had a problem with dogs.
