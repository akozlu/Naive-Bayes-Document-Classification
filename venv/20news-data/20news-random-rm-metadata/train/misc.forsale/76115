	However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX-PC'.  Also note the strange cross-posting (as he
probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on.  If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the "2C" jumper would be
the correct choice.

	I've left the cross-posting in effect, since I'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)

	DoN.
