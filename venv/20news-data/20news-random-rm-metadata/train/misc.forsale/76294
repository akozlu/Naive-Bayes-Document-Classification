Hey!!! I've just upgraded my laptop to a Windows-capable one, so I 
don't need my DOS word processor anymore.  It's a great word 
processor.  Easy-to-use, undemanding on the system, and
best of all, it has a WYSIWYG EDITING mode.  This is something
Word Perfect doesn't have!!  And all I'm asking is $65 + shipping.
It even comes with several hundred dollars of free utilities!!!

$65 for a full-featured WYSIWYG word processor!!!  Perfect for
a laptop, or a lower powered machine!
