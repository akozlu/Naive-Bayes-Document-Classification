  Sorry for any confusion I may have created.  The disk did come out of
a VS2000 and I would like to use it in a IBM PC clone.  The reason that I
posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because I saw the drive (XT2190) mentioned
in a for-slae notice.  I had asked for info before but didn't receive
any replies.

  Thanks once again for the help.
