I'm selling a bunch of my older 12" records off.  They are
sitting around collecting dust and I never use them.  I have used each
of these records, once, maybe twice if I didn't record the song I
wanted correctly the first time.  These records are in PERFECT
condition.  Please email me with the records you would want and what
you think a fair price is.  I will probably give deals, the more
records you buy.  Kinda capatalist isn't it.  Well give me a yell at 
pagorm@iastate.edu with any comments.  
						See ya

	I have recieved a few questions as to what 12" are.  I guess I
should elaborate.  (???!!!! am I that old?)  They are just
maxi-singles on wax.  If I am correct most beat mixers still use this
form of record.  This is probably the kind of person interested in
this colllect or parts of it. Any questions call (515) 294-3737.
Thanks and see ya.
