: I have a 486DX-33 computer with a SoundBlaster 1.0 card.  I'm running
: Microsoft Windows v3.1.  I have the SB driver set up properly to play
: normal sounds (.WAV files, etc.).  I want to play midi files through the
: Media Player that is included with windows.  I know I have to set up the
: patch maps or something in the MIDI-Mapper in the Control Panel.  I KNOW
: NOTHING ABOUT MIDI.  (This is to be the way I'll get my feet wet.)

: How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files?
If you install the Soundblaster windows drivers correctly, and have
the latest drivers, the media player should be setup to play files
authored to Microsoft's Multimedia midi authoring standard (General
Midi), see the section in the back of the Voyetra manual in the
Soundblaster midi upgrade kit.
You'll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different
mappings, so don't expect them to always sound correct without using
some kind of midi file editor, such as Voyetra's Sequencer Plus.
