Excuse me? Are you one of those people who *enjoy* working w/win? Come talk 
to a house-mate of mine and tell him how productive his life is when he 
encountered yet another sudden appearence of the DOS-prompt while cutting 
and pasting in win! Or an empty win screen without any tasks running (i.e.
^ESC brings up an empty list, progman has done it again.)
