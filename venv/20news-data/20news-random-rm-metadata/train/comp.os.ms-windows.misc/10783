	I don't think the question is:
		"will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?"

	A more important question is:
		"will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps
		from subsequent Windows versions in the future?"

	Can it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps?
	OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.
	After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to
	view Microsoft code.  After that, the only way to maintain
	some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would
	you want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?
