Hey, sounds great. Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI? I thought it   
uses NDIS.                                                                 
                                                                           
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my   
UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work      
along.                                                                      
                                                                            
I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just   
around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?                        
                                                                            
Regards, Richard
