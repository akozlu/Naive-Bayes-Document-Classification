about 2.5Kbyte without Novell 3.11 support.

No.

No.
Nearly all.

We run mixed WNT beta and W4WG, no problem apart from printer sharing( beta problem)

We had problems with mouse drivers using W4WG where Windows 3.1 didn't, seems to be 
more critical about it. It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on 0x2e0, we changed it to 0x300, now everything is allright, I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well.
