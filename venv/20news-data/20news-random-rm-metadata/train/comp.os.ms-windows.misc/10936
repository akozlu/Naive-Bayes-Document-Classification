Hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever consider
that inovation is not limited to software/hardware.  True, MS
products do not boast features that MS invented, but how many products
out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in
their continuing development? 

I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.
It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUI
that are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.
It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..
but they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operating
system, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
my tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common
user to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things 
do) and they either puke or faint.  

If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  But
for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware
that it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..

Oh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applications
they have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..
