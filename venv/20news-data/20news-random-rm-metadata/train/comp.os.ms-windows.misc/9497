It also runs OS/2 character based apps and POSIX apps.  The DOS, 16bit
and 32 bit windows apps run in a windows 32 bit subsystem.

If you consider the fact that NT has:
 the Lanman redirectors,
 built in support for TCP/IP
 built in support for NETBEUI
 comes with TCP utils like ping and an ftp client, etc
 applications like schedule+ and a 32 bit version of msmail

the storage argument isnt an issue.


I ran it on a 486 with 8MRAM and it did a ton of disk swapping, with a 19M
virtual memory paging file.  It functioned but it crawled.  (this was the OCT
build)

I upgraded the machine to 16M and the performance is good,
At that point I installed the March Build.  Consider they
are probably still working on the feature set, and havent done a lot of fine
tuning to the code yet.


I have little info on Chicago so I cant make a comparison.  Is it in Beta?  Is
there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison?
Just my $0.02
