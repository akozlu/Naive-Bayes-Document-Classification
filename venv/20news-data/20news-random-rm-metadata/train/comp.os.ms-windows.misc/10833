Do you mean that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior in _some_ respects (which
is trivially true), that it is objectively inferior in _all_ respecets
(which is trivially false) or do you mean something else? What criteria
have you chosen for your objective assesment? Are you sure that these
criteria are themselves objective?
