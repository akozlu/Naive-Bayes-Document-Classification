	Nah .... if MS Windows 3.1 were an operating system, so would be
X-windows, motif, geoworks , desqview, the shareware Win-Boss C library
and that what's-it's-name text-based windowing system written in Applesoft 
that ran on the old-faithful Apple II ... [ note the similarity? all
of the above rely on some underlying real OS  .... ]

	IMHO, they are windowing systems, and just that.  [ some are
cooler than others though ... ]
