I contacted Lotus about this problem today.  It has been reported previously
and there is a fix.  Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters
are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when
equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one
preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where
placed w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on has
occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters
to align equation frames.

Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this 
problem.
