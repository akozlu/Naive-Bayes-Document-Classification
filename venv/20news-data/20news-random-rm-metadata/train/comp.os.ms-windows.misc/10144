If it's any consolation, I had a similar problem. As I recall, if I exited
from a DOS session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a
scrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). It only
started happening after I used IconTitleFaceName in WIN.INI to change the
desktop font to Arial. So I stopped exiting from DOS sessions while in
full-screen mode.

My Mac used to do something similar. Aren't computers weird?
