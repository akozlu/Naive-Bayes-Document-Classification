According to the April issue of PC Magazine (pg. 139), and I quote,

"Eventually, Windows NT is likely to be ported to every successful RISC
architecture.  PowerPC and HP's PA-RISC are the two most likely candidates,
with SPARC somewhat less likely because of Sun's relatively strong UNIX
software base."
