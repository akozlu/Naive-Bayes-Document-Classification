From another not-so-distressed-but-still-wondering-about-a-few-things
Cardinal fan:

	He's not the greatest - this is true.
	I saw it.
	Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he
	could pinch hit if they needed him to.
	I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the 
	doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that
	he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
	speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely
	confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that
	particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?
	Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing
	but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play 
	Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.
	Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - 
	coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign 
	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  
	It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  
	BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the 
	replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year 
	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

	Well, I'm still hanging in there.

	GO REDBIRDS!!  WOOF, WOOF!!!
