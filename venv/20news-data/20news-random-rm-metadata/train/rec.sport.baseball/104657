I've only ever seen this called once.  Back around 1979-1980.  I think
that Steve Carlton was pitching.  On the other hand, I am not sure how
much effect this would have.  It seems that most of the time lost is
when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this.


I have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the
game.  Let's be serious.  The relief pitcher has normally been
throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes.  Does he really need 8
more pitches?
