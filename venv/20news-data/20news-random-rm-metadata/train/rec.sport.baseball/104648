Well, I don't want shorter games *per se*, but I would like for them to stop
*wasting* so much time during games. The Gant incident is a perfect example.
When a guy comes to the plate, he should be up there to hit, not show off
(or show up the umpire, which is clearly what Gant was doing). I feel like
writing a fan letter to Hirschbeck.
