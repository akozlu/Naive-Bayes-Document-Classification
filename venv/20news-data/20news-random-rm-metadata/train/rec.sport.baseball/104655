[argument over "reasonable" players and umpires deleted]



Yes, but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a
strike. There was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal.
Once he called it a strike the call could not be changed.  

I thought that the umpire did the right thing.
