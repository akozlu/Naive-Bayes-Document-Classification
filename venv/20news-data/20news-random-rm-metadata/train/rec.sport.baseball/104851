2 simple reasons:

(1)   Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a Left(Clark), 
      Right(Williams), Left(Bonds) situation in the middle of the
      batting order.  This makes it tougher for opposing manager
      to change pitchers.

(2)   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get
      more good pitches to hit.  This is important since he struggles
      so much with breaking balls.  Opposing pitchers don't want to
      walk Williams to get to Bonds.
