    THe bowler is John Burkett, who went to 4-0 last night.  He is
a bargain pickup on my roto team, I got him at a minimum of $5.

     This is not really true.  Excluding last season, the Giants
has been a better 2nd half team.  In 1991, they had a hot August
to pull to within a few games of the Braves and Dodgers before
fading in September.
     The Giants may go back to earth, but not as fast as last
season for two reasons:
(1)   Barry Bonds
(2)   Roger Craig is no longer the manager.  Dusty can manage
      his pitching staffs much better than Craig.
