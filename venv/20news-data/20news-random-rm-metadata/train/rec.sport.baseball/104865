a) Dominican
b) not all that light-hitting.  .304 lifetime, .315 or so in 1966-73
when he did most of his playing.  
c) Professional pinch-hitter after that.  Yes, that also gives you
Jerry Hairston.


Beginning 10th year now.


Good one.


Not the same thing.  LOTS of people are bad OFs.


Not all that light either.  .750 OPS.


Not 10 year.

Yup.


OK.

*Six*-year this year.


Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith);
that seems to be a special class.  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get 
more of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well.  And Brock
wasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he 
spoiled his ifetime .300 BA.

And again, I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time.  But if
you look at the history of the last three decades, there seems to 
be a clear race-based pattern by which utility players and platoon
players and lesser talents stayed in the ML far longer if they were
white.


Light hitting?  199 HR, .793 lifetime OPS mainly with *HOUSTON*?
Also Latin, btw.



Come back in 1999 and we'll party^H^H^H^H^H talk.
