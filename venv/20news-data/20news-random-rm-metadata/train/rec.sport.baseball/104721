  Ok, Roger, here's a question for you.  Say you are running an expansion
team.  You don't HAVE a team at the moment, but the draft is coming up.  Who
are you going to pick, guys who have won the most WS rings, or guys who 
COULD contribute the most to your team.  Say the Reds were dumb enough to 
not protect Larkin, and the Jays didn't protect Alfredo.  Who would you
pick?
