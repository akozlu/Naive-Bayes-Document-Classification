When I say "black," I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this
discussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one 
team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did.  


Don't know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history 
includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority; 
the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been
the object of national obsession.


Absolutely.  As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing.
But it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG's and all that is 
not without some small reason.


Well, there's the list.  Go for it!  I'll cull some more names as I go.
I expect you're right, btw.
