Second, Franklin to the rescue! Here's the list:
Player        HR  SB
Aaron        755 240
Mays         660 338
FRobinson    586 204
RJackson     563 228
Winfield     406 216 *
Dawson       377 304 *
Baylor       338 285
BoBonds      332 461
Wynn         291 225
Strawberry   280 201 *
Morgan       268 689
Pinson       256 309
Yount        235 247 *
KGibson      208 253 *
Sandberg     205 297 *
