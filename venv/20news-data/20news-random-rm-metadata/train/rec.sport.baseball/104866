Stole 300 bases.  (Ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't
think so, they think he, like Omar Moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff
man.  Awesome defense.)


He's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR.


Hasn't played 10+ years in the bigs.  Wasn't a full-time major-leaguer
until 1988.


Consistent .300 hitter.


We'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.


Same goes for Herm.


Doesn't count then.


Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  Close to
800 OPS career against LHP.


We'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify.


Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'
parks in the NL.  He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this
year.  Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver
and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox.


Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being
weak offensively, though of course he was.  Led NL in SB his first six
years in the majors.


We'll see if he's still around in 1997.


Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year
stretch and led the league in triples five times.  But we can count him
if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon
deluxe with slightly worse defense.


Okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also
in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome.


He's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.


Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.


Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as
light-hitting.  Neither was Curt Flood.  Cesar Cedeno was *not* light-
hitting.


He'll have to steal a lot more bases.
