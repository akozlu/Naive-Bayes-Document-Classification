one i saw had vented rears too...it was on a lot.
of course, the sales man was a fool..."titanium wheels"..yeah, right..
then later told me they were "magnesium"..more believable, but still
crap, since Al is so m uch cheaper, and just as good....


i tend to agree, tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to "standard"
for running 130 on a regular basis.  The brakes should be bigger, like
11" or so...take a look at the  ones on the Corrados.(where they have
braking regulations).
