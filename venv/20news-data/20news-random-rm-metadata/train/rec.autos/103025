Having spoken to technical staff from Ford many times, I can assure you that 
internally at Ford this car is always called the Taurus "Show" or just  
"the Show".  As in long "o" sound.  I still refer to it as the "S-H-O",
however, because it sounds better to me. I assume many purist fans and owners 
prefer using the Ford lingo.
