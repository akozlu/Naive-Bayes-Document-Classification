I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own
question?  Is the reflected signal "shifted" at all from the
act of being reflected?  If so, wouldn't it then be easy for
the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
sources?
