who cares about typos of these meaningless, synthetic names?  if the
cars were named after a person, e.g. honda, i'd be more respectful.


wrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a
V6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline
6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.
