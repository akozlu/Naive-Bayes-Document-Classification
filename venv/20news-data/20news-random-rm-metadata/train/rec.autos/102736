Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp
(forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have
an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience.
