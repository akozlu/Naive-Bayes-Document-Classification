Oh, really. When?


The '93 Mustang Cobra can. Check it out.


Ehhhh, maybe. The '93 Mustang Cobra does a good job for a lower price,
and it's just a taste of what's ahead in the 30th Anniversary of
the original Pony Car.


Just think! Corvettes are almost up to the performance levels
of a '65 Cobra! Wow! In a few years, they might be up to the
performance levels of a '66 Ford GT-40. Wow, man, just think
about it... ;-)
