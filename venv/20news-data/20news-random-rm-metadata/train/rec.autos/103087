You moved from Alabama to California?  My sympathies.


Make sure that they have all maintenance records.  Oil should be changed
every 3 months.  The mileage on the cars is fine.

Be sure that these have the 16 valve engine.  The 8 valve 318 is a 
BMW in name only.  

Didn't you have a line on a '89 325i for 12K? Jump on it.
