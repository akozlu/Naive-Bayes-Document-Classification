 THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin
theirs.... implying that the Nissan Quest/ Murcury Villager are out-selling
the Chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid
claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
vans.  Kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh?
