actually, disabled persons have been known to drive in SCCA
races.  i'd be careful about making sweeping generalizations here.

i'd prefer a manual transmission, but the early SHO had an
awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something.
it was almost enough to make me want an automatic.
