A dealer will make money off you in three ways, if you let him:

	1)  New car markup over his cost (remember his hold-back),
	2)  Arranging financing through the dealership, and
	3)  Screwing you on the trade.

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at 
"dealer's cost" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a 
kickback from the bank.

Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average 
retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself, 
try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.

Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.
