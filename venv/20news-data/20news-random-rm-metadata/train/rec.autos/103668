We used to have a tax in Greece named after the Queen's Mother. The Queen
left (Monarchy was abolished) but the tax stuck...

Similar single purpose taxes have stuck (i.e. to help the victims of 
the earthquake of 19XX, build the Metro)

ObMoralConclusion: next time someone proposes a car tax or gasoline tax
promising it's temporary, it AIN'T.
