Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as 
heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then, in fact.
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here 
about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear 
about something like that, period. 

Sorry about posting to rec.autos, but this is where it came up...
