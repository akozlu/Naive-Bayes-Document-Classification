Oh no!  Say it isn't so!


Yes, Yl|nen is a draft choice of the Jets.  (Assuming, of course, this
is the same Yl|nen that played for Kiekko-Espoo in 1990-91.)  He was a
5th round, 91st overall pick of the Jets in the 1991 entry draft.

I noticed in the summaries that Yl|nen had really begun to play well in
the playoffs.
