Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical
odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three
straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't
include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker
team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made
the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as
good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though!
It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie
Gibson :-)


Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4
starts.  Fuhr has been too tough.  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in
time...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10.


It's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something.  Actually
it's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the
competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about
who wins or loses :-)


I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away.
They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.


Good point here.  Chicago's in deep trouble tonight.  The 'Hawks have a bad
past history of winning the division and losing early.  When they don't finish
1st, they do okay.
