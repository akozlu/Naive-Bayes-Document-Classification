IMHO...

Clement, although he has a pleasant personality (aggravatingly pleasant
in my opinion), is a terrible
analyst, because he is almost alway wrong...the prototypical example
being New Jersey's first goal last Sunday.

I grew up with Dick Irvin doing color beside Danny Gallivan...I knew
did Irvin, Dick Irvin was a friend of mine...Bill Clement you aren't
any Dick Irvin.

As long as the teams involved do not include the US national team or
the New York Rangers, I'd take John Davidson over Bill Clement any
day.
