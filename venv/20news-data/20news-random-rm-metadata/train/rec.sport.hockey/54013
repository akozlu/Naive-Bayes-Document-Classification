That's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just
take winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team
lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory.

While I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better
high back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago, and the Rangers last
year. Too much of a good thing is not always good for you.
