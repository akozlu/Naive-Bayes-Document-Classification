I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first "modern" coach.
Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room
in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates
the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games
listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to
what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. 
Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free 
in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was
trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!

I am left asking "What is a modern coach if not Bowman?"
