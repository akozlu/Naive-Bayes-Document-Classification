Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than
those of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after
him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they
were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the
league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.
Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the 
sport itself?   


I can't disagree with you here.



What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He
originated the phrase "if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat
'em on the ice."  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,
that Don Cherry is a classy individual?


The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and
that is: "it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice"

Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have
always thought that this was nonsense.
