: I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show
: the shots, not the hits.  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
: on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  They panned
: back to show the rebound.  Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more 
: experienced.



: Joseph Stiehm

Exactly.  That is my biggest complaint about the coverage so far.
Follow that damn puck!
