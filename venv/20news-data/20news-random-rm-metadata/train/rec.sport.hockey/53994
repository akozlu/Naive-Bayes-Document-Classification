You can get WJR a LONG way away.  The problem is that, because of those
well known and beloved "contractual obligations", WJR will be doing
Tiger baseball instead of the Wings playoff games for probably half
the games the Wings could play.  For this series, I know tonight's
game and I believe games 5 and 6 (if necessay) will be bumped.
