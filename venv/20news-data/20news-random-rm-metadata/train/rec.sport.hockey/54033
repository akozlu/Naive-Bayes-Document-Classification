Yeah, it's the second one.  And I believe that price too.  I've been trying
to get a good look at it on the Bruin-Sabre telecasts, and wow! does it ever
look good.  Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing.  And given
Fuhr's play since he got it, I bet the Bruins are wishing he didn't have it:)
