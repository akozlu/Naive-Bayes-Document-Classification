I'm totally p*-o'd, too!  Vancouver-Winnipeg is great west-coast hockey -
fast-paced and loads of talent.  What I've seen so far is hardly
entertaining, with the exception of the odd shift every now & then (of
course I missed Calgary-LA & Pitts-Jersey...)


Amen...


That's cheaper than what I do - PHONE CALLS.  (There must be a better
system - one ring, Adams to Linden, he SCORES; two rings Bure rushes up
the ice, he SCORES, etc etc :-))
