Roger Maynard shares his views, with the masses, on Bob Gainey
and life in general:
 
 
 
 
It was Bryan Trottier, not Denis Potvin.  It was a vicious
'boarding' from behind...Trottier was given a major.
 
But Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill
as a hockey player?  If Probert smashes Gilmour's head into the
boards next week, will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour's
skills?
 
 
I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.
 
I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him
on this list.  I also think you have a relatively naive view
about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of
any team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their
contribution...I think that most people understand that it's not
the Nobel Prize...so settle down.
 
 
 
 
congenially, as always,
