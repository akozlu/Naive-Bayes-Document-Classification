Well, I could become a fan ... (-;

Seriously, this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the
Islanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
everywhere that I've sampled ... in fact, the playoffs almost don't
exist now. )-; Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One's
midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near-
orgasm over Keenan's hiring.  (Summarizing: Keenan is a winner and
will give the Broadway Bums 'da business' in pursuing the next Cup
chase ...)


This will be an interesting combination to watch ... Keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach, but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  A lot of big
player moves will happen --- remember that Keenan got rid of Denis
Savard.  The country club days are over ...


If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered
Keenan the big money to put-up-and-shut-up back in January, the
Rangers might not be heading for golf now ...



One of Keenan's first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier
will be the team's captain.


By then, Smith might have some bargains on Keenan's advice ... like
maybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi ... (-;
