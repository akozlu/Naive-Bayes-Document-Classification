Perish the thought...but you know, you may be right, at least as far
as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go.  They all seem to be
becoming BIG MONEY games, much more so than at any previous time.  To
think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now,
all that may be there is an AHL team, at best...SIGH.
