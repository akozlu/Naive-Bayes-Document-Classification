  Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But
   what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid
   baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores
   to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and 
   football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid
   basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that
   was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during
   the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..

   I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve
   by next season...
