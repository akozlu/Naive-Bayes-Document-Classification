As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem
with violence in the sport of hockey.  How the hell can you say the guy is
a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting
a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new 
referee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons
get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the 
play.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an
improvement.
