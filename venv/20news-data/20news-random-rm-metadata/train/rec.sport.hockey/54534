On the other hand, I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
Fereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight.

Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management, the attempt
to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra.
I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept
him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  (Wonder what
sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax?  (His job, I guess.))

have fun
