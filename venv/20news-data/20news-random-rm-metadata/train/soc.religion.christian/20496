Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the
case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and
also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would 
cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of 
Christ.

Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the
time they were made.  "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" refers both
to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   "Why do the heathen rage"
was said of David and also of Christ.  

Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, "and his bishoprick
let another take."  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His
disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, "the children thou
hast given me."

How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.
