I do not like a God who prays to Himself.  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed
to Himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the
Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son.  I have no
problems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scriptures
co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.
 
Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.
When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.
 
If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.
If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.
 
But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.
