	I realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do
have one question. Wasn't it a Reagan appointee, James Watt, a
pentacostal christian (I think) who was the secretary of the interior
who saw no problem with deforestation since we were "living in the
last days" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods
anyway?
