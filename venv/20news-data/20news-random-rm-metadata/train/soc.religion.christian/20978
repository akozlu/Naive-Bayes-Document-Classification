I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators.
As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures
into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and 
developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read).
It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governments
want the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the 
Mexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is not
cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.

To understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books
(autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.  One
that stands out in my mind as an excellent is called "Peace Child."
This would give a true picture of what their mission is.

I agree with this statement, but we cannot also accept what others
say without looking into the issues.  That would be the same as taking 
Suddan's discussion about the CIA, etc. as being true.  We must look
at both sides.
