The only info I have is my area is not having a large march.  They are leaving
it up to each congragation.  IMO this means organizers found it too difficult
to manage or no one feels the need to be involved.

I'm not casting stones, my involvement with the Lord does not include the March
this year.  Maybe He is giving a message by the lack of one??  JLS
