I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental.  I think
that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they
were trying to say that headbangers would like the program.  But I would
NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc.  it is
condescending.  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him.

By the way, Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.

Personally, I'm a headbanger at times too, but I have a hard time with what
most of the secular metal groups promote.  Free sex and drugs (my opinion
that many promote these) aren't my thing.  I HAVE found several good
Christian metal groups that I like.
