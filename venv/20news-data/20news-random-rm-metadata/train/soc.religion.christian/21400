	That last paragraph just about killed me.  The Deuterocanonicals have
	ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church,
	which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there.
	It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to
	REMOVE certain books--not the fact that the Catholic Church decided
	to add some much later--that is the reason for the difference between
	"Catholic" and "Protestant" bibles.
