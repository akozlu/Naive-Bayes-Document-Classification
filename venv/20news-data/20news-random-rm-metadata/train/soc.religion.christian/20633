I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few
years back and I can't cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who
was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded
to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave
to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the
true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to
*conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of
*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in 
which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate
to one another and to God.

IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served 
on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in 
which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker 
in federal prison.
