Did this happen to Jesus? I don't think so, not from what I heard. He lived
ONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then
JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?

I'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through, but I seriously
want a reasonable explanation for this.
