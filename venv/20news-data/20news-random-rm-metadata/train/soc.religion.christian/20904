My impression is that *for advanced work* you will be much better off with
German reference works (lexicons, concordances especially).  For a first-time
encounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in
my native language.  But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the
reference books you think you can handle.  (I only know these works by
reputation, since my German is most rusty, but I'd look at the following books:
Koehler's lexicon, Mandeldern's concordance, the Jenni & Westermann theological
dictionary of the OT.)


The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely,
mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school.  Presbyterian
and Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical
languages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral
program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But
there are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the
attitude seems to be more, "Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give you
a semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . .")
