I'd love to know how "Jesus only" proponents would answer questions like:

-Who is this "Father" Jesus keeps referring to? Why does He call Himself "the
Son"?

-Why does He pray to the Father, and not to himself?

-Why does He emphasize that he does his Father's will, and not his own?  If He
 was doing his own will, what kind of example is that?  Should we follow it?

-When He says he has to return to the Father, who is He going to?

-When He says he does this in order that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit might
 come, who might that be?

-If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that it's
 worth His leaving us and returning to the Father, what can that mean if there
 is no Holy Spirit?

-Why doesn't the best known Christian prayer begin "Our Saviour, who art in
 heaven," rather than "Our Father?"

Do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible?

(Further entertaining queries are left as an exercise to the reader.)
