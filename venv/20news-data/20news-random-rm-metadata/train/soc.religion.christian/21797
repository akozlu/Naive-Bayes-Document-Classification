It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think:
something about "amare errantem, interficere errorem", which sounds
more like "love the errant, slay the error".  No doubt someone else 
will know in particular who minted the phrase.  If I had to guess, I'd
blame :-)  St Augustine, who seems to have had a gift for aphorism.
