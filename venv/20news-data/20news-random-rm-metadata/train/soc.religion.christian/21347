pwhite@empros.com (Peter White) relates a story about a person who 
gives a message in tongues which consists entirely of the words pu'
ka.  He was asked to refrain from doing that.



Nice story but it sets off my urban legend (or is it charismatic
legend?) alarms.  Can the linguists on the net identify the language
from the description?  Or can they even attest that such a language
exists.  It seems to be odd enough (at least by the standards of
European languages) that if it exists, it should be reasonably well
known to linguists as an extreme case of something or other.

Or have I just overreacted to your basic shaggy dog story?
