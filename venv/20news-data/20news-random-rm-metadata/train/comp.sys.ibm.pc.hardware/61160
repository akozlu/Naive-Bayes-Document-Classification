The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most
of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are
better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the
DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.
