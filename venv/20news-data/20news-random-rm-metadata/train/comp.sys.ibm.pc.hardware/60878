Hi,

I recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because
we needed the extra drive bays and better power supply.  This case has LED's
for the processor speed, i.e. 33.  Is there a place to plug this in on the
motherboard?  If not, is there anyway to hack something to make it work?

TIA!
