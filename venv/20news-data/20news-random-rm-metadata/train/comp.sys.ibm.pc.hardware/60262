As of today I will no longer be a contact for Zeos International on the net.
This responsibility has been taken over by another tech (davidm@zeos.com) and I
am moving up and on (mo money, mo money :)).  I just wanted to thank all of the
netters who have supported and encouraged the participation of Zeos on the net.
I personally feel it is important for companies such as Zeos to provide their
customers with as easy access as possible when they have questions/problems and
being on the net is an big step in the right direction.  I hope that other
companies will follow suit (as Weitek and others have done). Again, thanks.
