I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is
DX2/66 VLB. I has the save transfer rate of 0.647 MB/s regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between
5.5MHz and 8.33MHz. Not _any_ difference. The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory.

My advice: Buy 4Megs of RAM, save $70 and enjoy performance.
