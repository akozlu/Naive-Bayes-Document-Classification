I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no
maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the 
item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid
for it.
Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims.
Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)
