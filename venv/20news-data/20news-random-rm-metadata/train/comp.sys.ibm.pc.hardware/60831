I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V,
8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only
COM1-3 are available.  I believe this is documented somewhere in the
system manuals, but I can't recall where.
