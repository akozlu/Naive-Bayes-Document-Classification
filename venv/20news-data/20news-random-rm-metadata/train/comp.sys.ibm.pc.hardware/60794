GCC and other big programs seemed to crash about 15% of the time for me.
gcc gave something like "program as got fatal signal 11" and when doing
anything past the complexity of elvis, kermit, etc, I got kernel general
protection faults at *least* once a session.

I disabled my cache as suggested, and bingo, Linux is as stable as a rock
(it hasn't given me a core dump or kernel error yet).

Does any one know why the cache would do something like this?
