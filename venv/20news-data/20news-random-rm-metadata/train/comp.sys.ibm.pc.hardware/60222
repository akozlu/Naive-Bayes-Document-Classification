Hello,

you're not quite sure if that's a joke or not? Anyway you read the article!

--> You're right!!!

(1. The header (only this) IS a joke, 2. it's worth reading)

Perhaps some of you know my regular 'List of IDE Harddisk specs' where I
give all available information about IDE Harddrives. I am strongly
interested in contacting the manufacturers directly. But I have no money
for overseas calls, so I need

	HARDDISK MANUFACTURER's  EMAIL ADDRESSES

Please help if you can!

Carsten.
