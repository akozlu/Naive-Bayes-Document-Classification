<speaking of CPU fans>


Do these CPU Fans also have heat sinks?  Do you recommend using both
on the same chip (i.e. heat sink sandwiched between CPU and Fan)?

If we are just talking about a CPU Fan blowing directly on the CPU chip,
I can't see how "heat sink grease" is necessary (or even desireable).
