	I have one and it is my favorite CD-ROM drive so far.  I also have 
a NEC-74 and have had experience with several other drives (Various 
Phillips drives)

	The 3401 is faster than the NEC, I like its door better (the NEC 
needs 2 hands), the XA handling (The NEC needs to be re-booted to go from 
XA to ROM while the 3401 does it on the fly), All in all I am seriously 
considering replacing my NEC with another Toshiba.
