  Hmm your CD-Rom program must be using some oddball VGA modes.

  I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when
it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they
have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out
a bit later).

  Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal
frequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version.  It can
do 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!),
1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and
800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth 
monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,
otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)

  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should
go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the
video sig.  There're several Hercules reps there that are very
helpful.
