I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning.  I took him at his word, and I 
have not tried to find out any more about it, because I'm not going to back 
everything up just to add another HDD.  If anyone knows for sure what the 
scoop is, I would like to know also.  Thanks in advance also.
