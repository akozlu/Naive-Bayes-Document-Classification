Still no good.  WatchIT TV will not work on a with local bus video.
It will not work in any high reolution modes either.  The people who
make the card assure me that they will have a card available in June 
that supports both local-bus and hi-res.  BTW does anyone know the
name of the company who makes watchit tv?  Phone #?  BBS? Internet?

Thanks
