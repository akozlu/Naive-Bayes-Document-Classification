	I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I
can't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is
*extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color
monitors, which is a 19" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good,
perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across.
	BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well
as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG
can.
