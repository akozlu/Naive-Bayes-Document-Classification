XGA or XGA-2?  For the original XGA you just need something that can do
1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them "8514 compatible" and they
should get the idea).  For the XGA-2, get what you like.  I prefer multi-
syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
my home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them
in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like
1360x1024x16.
