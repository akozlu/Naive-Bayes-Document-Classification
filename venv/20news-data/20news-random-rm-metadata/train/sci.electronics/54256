Hello, I'm curious what sort of neat features exist on high-end
answering machines today. In particular, I'm interested in
features of digital answering machines. Also, what is the
typical amount of storage(in minutes) for these digital answering
machines?

The reason? I'm hacking together an answering machine program
for my ZyXEL modem and I'm wondering if I'm missing something
on my wish list.
