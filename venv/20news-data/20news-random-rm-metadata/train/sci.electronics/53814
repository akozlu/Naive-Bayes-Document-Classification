The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries
(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost
one.
