At 50 miles, a conventional set of TV antennas on a pole (one aimed
at each transmitter location) should work well.

"Rabbit ears" inside the house are probably not adequate.

Gadgets to plug into your house wiring are even worse.
At VHF, you don't want a _big_ antenna, you want a _resonant_
antenna.
