Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it
did the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the
same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.

#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll 
*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any
case, don't kick it around! :-) 

#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned
out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!.
