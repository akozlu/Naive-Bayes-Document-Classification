One week to the Robot Olympic games.  Fire up the mechanoids for combat
and come on down.

Competitors please note that there has been a slight change; the registration
desk will now be in the forward building of the Science Centre rather than
in the main competing hall.  When you arrive, please go to this desk.  Those
that have pre-registered by real-mail will find badges waiting.

Is all.  See you here.
