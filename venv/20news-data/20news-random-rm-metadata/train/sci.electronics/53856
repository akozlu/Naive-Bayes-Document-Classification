One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark 
a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get 
around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal' 
users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. Whatever you do, please do 
_not_ use a hardware key. These were very popular a few years ago, and they 
STINK!!
