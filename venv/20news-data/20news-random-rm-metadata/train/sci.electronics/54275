May I tease out a sub-thread from this discussion?

Can you all please tell me how to remove  the stickers from new houses'
appliances and outdoor lampposts?  Especially the lamppost, right on
the glass.  Isn't there something you can rub into stuck-on labels that
will release them from their death-grip on glass or other hard surfaces?

Many thanks for any help.
