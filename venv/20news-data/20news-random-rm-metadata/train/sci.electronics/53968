Probably won't help.  I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer
used those little self-contained modules.  I think Sharp made them.
Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)

The module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  It
contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator
all in a tiny metal can.

If you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can
probably order one.  BTW - the carrier frequency is 40 KHz, and each
different TV/VCR/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse
scheme to perform each different function on their equipment.
