I didn't say the program is DISABLED, did I?  (I HATE!!!! it when people
take my words out of context...)  I mean that once you have installed it,
you cannot DEinstall it without registering it, or transfer it to another
machine, or SOME SORT OF LIMITATION (the author will decide), WHICH WILL
BE REMOVED WHEN THE PROGRAM IS REGISTERED.
