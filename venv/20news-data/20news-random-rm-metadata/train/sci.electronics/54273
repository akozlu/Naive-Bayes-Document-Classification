We use a CD-ROM based system here.  There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a
4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned
images of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for
something it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.
THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.
It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand
the data base to handle more types of stuff.

These systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get
monthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to
them so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a
yearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.

If you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a
page-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can
also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page
printing takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump
the 5 or 6 pages you usually need.

I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available
to all Internet users.    :-)
