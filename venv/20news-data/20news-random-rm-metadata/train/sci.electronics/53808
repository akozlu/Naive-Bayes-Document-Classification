Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  If not,
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box. If you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level. Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebody's unlisted number.  Fess up.
