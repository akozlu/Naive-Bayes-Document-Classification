Oh, yeah.  This is a fine place.  We haven't had the "why does concrete
kill lead-acid batteries" thread in at least six months.


The concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains
them into the ground.

Another explanation, implausible as it is,  is that the lead-acid battery
needs to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery
self-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction.

Naawwwww.... the concrete sucks the life out.
