Not entirely true. A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game
GODS and asked me for help since he could not find a "trainer" (small
patch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed but
I did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file
would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the "shield" in the
game from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.

There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or
another and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copy
protection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,
compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly
compressed), dongles, key disks, etc...

I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection
schemes.
