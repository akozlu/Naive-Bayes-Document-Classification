May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground is
supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest
looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for
power and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now own
the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities
you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...
