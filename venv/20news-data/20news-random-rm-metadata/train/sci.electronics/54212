Sorry Ian, I haven't toyed with it in several years. I haven't seen
the insides in quite a few years. I just saw the post lagging for
quite a few days, and thought I'd toss in my $0.02. I assume the 6507
was functionally similar to the 6502 (was it also made by MOS
Technologies?). I really am more versed in the (6502 based) Atari
computers. The 2600 came later on.


In the Atari computers, the "CIA" chip you refer to sounds an awful
lot like the CTIA (Color Television Interface Adapter) chip used in
the early models. Later Atari upgraded this to the GTIA (Graphics
...). Other colorful literature stated that the GTIA might have stood
for "George," the developer of the chip.


Funny, I had an old and new model. The old one was SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.


Sorry, I am way out of line here. My first microcontroller I built was
a MC68701 based chipset with 128 bytes onboard. That was not easy to
work with (in addtion to a small 2K on-board EPROM).
