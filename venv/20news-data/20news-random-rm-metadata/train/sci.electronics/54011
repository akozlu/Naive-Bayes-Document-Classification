Well, yes and no.  The _image_ can't be on the screen less than 1/30
of a second, but a _mixture_ of images that's about 90% of the field
that was supposed to be there and 10% of the 'subliminal' addition
could be overlaid for one field, producing the same overall effect to
our sluggish retinae of a discrete image projected for 1/300 second.

..although, like the previous poster, I have to reserve my doubts
about the effectiveness of said discrete image in steering my
subconscious around ..
