   How much software is out there for the Mac?  I've been interested
in using microcontrollers in imbedded applications for a long time,
but was always under the impression that I would need an IBM to run
the debug/compile/etc software.
   I would like to use a 6811 or 6816.  I'm proficient in 6800 assembly,
but have never NEEDED it except some toying with old 6802EVBs.

   Motorola doesn't seem to have any information on Mac software (at
least their local distributor doesn't) and the ELE department around
here has been of little help as well.
   I hope someone can tell me that I don't have to buy an IBM to 
work with the 6811 or 6816 Evaluation Boards...please send me mail!
