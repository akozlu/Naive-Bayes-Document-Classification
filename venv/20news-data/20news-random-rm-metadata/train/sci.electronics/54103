I'm glad to see this idea come up because I've had something similar in mind.
What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address 
data.  When the user registers, you don't even need to send executable code, 
just compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the 
appropriate place the following:

Name=Joe Doe
Address=123 Main Street
City=Anytown, CA
key=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd
