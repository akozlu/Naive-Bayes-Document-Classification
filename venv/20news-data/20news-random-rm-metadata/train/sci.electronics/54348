Sorry Geoff,

Agree solder mask is green, but in the old days we didn't have wave soldering
machines (which are another topic again).  I had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning!

Board under the mask was the original query.

BTW cheap inport electronic devices (mainly from 3rd world countries) are done
with brown pheonolic boards.  Is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools.  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home.  They are very obviously hand soldered.  Quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into Canada from Red China.  In China there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours.  One of my
co-workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost 50%.

Also, the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press.  An old lithographer friend had a press for this.  After the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors.
