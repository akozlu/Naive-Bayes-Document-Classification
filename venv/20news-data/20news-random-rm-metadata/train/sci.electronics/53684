<lots of pretty good stuff about how the huge towers near most nuclear
power plants are there to cool the used steam back into near ambient
temperature water deleted>



    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this
country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot, and
then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,
which is about 30 miles north of NYC, and built more or less 1958.
