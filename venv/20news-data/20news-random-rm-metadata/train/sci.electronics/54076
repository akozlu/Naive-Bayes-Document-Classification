See if Radio Shack has a National Semiconductor Adjustable Voltage 
Regulator, (National) part number: LM350T or LM350K.  These devices are 
rated for an input to output differential of up to 35 Volts @ 3 Amps.

Digi-Key Corp. has these parts, as well as several other useful regulators.
If you don't have their catalog, their phone number is: 1-800-344-4539.

I can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 7.5 VDC nicad battery 
with this device, and if I'm right, you may want to look through some of the 
hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits, first.

If you get stuck, e-mail me your FAX number, if you have one, and I'll send 
you some suggestions or schematics.
