I would suggest Draw for Windows (by Micrografx).  I have this on my
home box.  Its quite impressive and only cost UKL100.  It has a rather
nice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own
drawings.  There is no circuit component clip-art included, but you
could add your own quite easily.

It works with any Windows printer driver of course, and can also
export embedded postscript and PCX files.

Note: I am not connected with Micrografx in any way.
