: What if clipper is fairly secure but leaves a distinct clipper signature...
: that is, what if it's not too difficult to tell that a msg. was clipper
: encrypted, even if you can't tell the contents?  In that case, anyone 
: who is trying to hide behind anther encryption scheme will stand out
: from all of the other traffic and raise a red flag to the NSA, etc.

I think the obvious answer (which may have been posted, but I haven't
seen it) is to encrypt your data with some other scheme, then run it
through clipper.  The only way the police will be able to detect the
other encryption is through a wiretap, so even if they do notice with
an illegal wiretap, I have a hard time seeing a judge issuing a
warrant for a search to "confiscate" the illegal scheme (assuming that
at one day, it comes to this; a worse case) based on an illegal
wiretap.  Then again, maybe I am an idealist.  :>
