One thing that seems ambiguous is whether a signal being echoed down from
geosynchronous orbit is "...from outside the United States."

Also, being able to assess whether NSA is playing by the rules requires
knowing what the rules are. We only know a subset. For those even more
suspicious, there could be other surveillance organizations "blacker"
than the NSA.
