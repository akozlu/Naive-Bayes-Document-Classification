The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere, I insert
my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom:


   Look! This is clearly the first step toward outlawing our
   own screw thread specifications. If this madness isn't fought,
   tooth and nail, every step of the way, it'll be a crime to use
   screw threads other than those our Fearless Leaders so *graciously*
   define for us.


   Rubbish, I say! ANSI standard screw threads will have subtle weaknesses,
   allowing their agents to disassemble our automobiles more easily,
   causing our mufflers to fall off at inoppurtune moments.


	Hah! "trust us"


	See??! See? This is the first step.

	It is clear we must band together, write your congressman!
Use Pretty Good Screw Threads, not this devil-inspired ANSI trash.
Protect your constitutional right to use whatever screw thread you
desire. Guerilla Screw Thread Activism must become the order of the
day. Boycott GM, and build your own car, using screws from STZ
Screw Thread Associates.

	Screw you, Bill Clinton! You and your totalitarianist thugs!
