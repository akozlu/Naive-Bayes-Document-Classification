Khufu and Khafre are both patented (#5003597).  Biham and Shamir showed
that differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round Khafre with a chosen-
plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions.  Khafre with 24 rounds
can be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions.
(There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if
someone wants to take the time to look.)

Khufu has key-dependent S-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.
Source code for this algorithm (and Khafre) are in the patent.

Snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function.  The version of Snefru
that produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
(vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for
four passes or less.  Given that, SHA and MD5 are much more efficient.
