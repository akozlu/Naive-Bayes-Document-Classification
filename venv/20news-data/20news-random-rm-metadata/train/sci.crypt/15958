David,

  While I disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government,
I think you have a good idea here. There is danger that, with funding coming
from asset forfeitures, the government could continue to promulgate a bad
product in spite of poor acceptance. Making the product pay its way (as
it must for private ventures) would be a good incentive for quality and
listening to we, the ranters. :)
