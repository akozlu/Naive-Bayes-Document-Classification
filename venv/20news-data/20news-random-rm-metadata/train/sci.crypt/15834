your hands.

I type corrected.  (:-)


English revolution-> what revolution?  They never had one.  
India-> If they could get around their religion restrictions
Mexico-> Point Taken, I forgot about this one.  
France-> Napoleon Bonepart would have something to say about this.
Holland-> I didn't know they had one, won't comment because I don't know
enough.


Actually, I consider the issue on topic.  When you start gambling with
fire crackers, sooner or later, somebody is going to lose a hand.


Fine.  Exercise the right to free speech.  That's great!  But don't resort
to armed violence until there's no other possibility.


No.  I believe there are bad cops, and good cops.  There are bad people,
and good people.  (And all that grey inbetween.)  

I have had the pleasure of knowing a police officer who did his best to
uphold the laws he swore to defend.  I have also seen what happens when
police power is abused.

Don't generalize in either direction.  It just causes problems.


Me either.  Nice can of worms, ain't it?
