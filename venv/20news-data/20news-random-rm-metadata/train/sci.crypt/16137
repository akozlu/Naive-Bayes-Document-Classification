Evil and good walk hand in hand.  It is also important to note that
the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools.


I cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic.  Technology is neutral
to good or evil.  When technology is used by "evil" men, it is called
evil technology.  When it is used by "good" men, it is called good
technology.  Really, it is just technology that allows action to be
realized more efficently and on a larger scale.


Try not to confused the development of technology with its use.
Certainly, "bright" people will be better at creating technology, but
even young children know how to program VCR machines.  Are VCR
machines not extremely complex to create?


Adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
stiff and stubborn.  A young child is soft and supple; an old man is
stiff and inflexible.  A dripping of water can cut through stone.
This has nothing to do with technology, rather technology just
allows us to magnify action.


I have no objection to this!  :)
