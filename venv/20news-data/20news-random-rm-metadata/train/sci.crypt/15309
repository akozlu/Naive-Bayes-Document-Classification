If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, you effectively have
secure crypto.  If secret backups are kept...then you effectively have
no crypto.  Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better
than secure crypto.

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, then the government will
just have to use normal law enforcement techniques to catch crooks.  Is
this so bad?   BTW, bugging isn't YET a normal law enforcement technique.
With the privacy clipper, it WILL become a normal technique.
