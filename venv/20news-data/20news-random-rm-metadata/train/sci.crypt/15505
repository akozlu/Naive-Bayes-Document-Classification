Actually, old video games and pinball machines are supposed to work pretty
good (at blocking EM eavesdropping), too.  Those things put out a LOT of EM
noise.  Back in the 80's, I read about computer companies putting bunches
of games in their buildings for just this purpose (not to mention the $$$).
