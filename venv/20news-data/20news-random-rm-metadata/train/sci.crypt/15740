Well, isn't this just a hoot! :)  All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt.
This just happens to be a case of an ordinary-joe-netter, who decided
that he would create and/or distribute some misinformation.  Ppl buy
into BS posts like this (I know, because I forwarded a copy of the
post to my office mate, who turned around and was (although he won't
admit it...sorry Joe!) ready to get in a fight about F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E!!!)
Please, if we're going to hold our govt (which admittedly has had and
still has its problems) to high standards, then mustn't we follow these
too?  Electronic Freedoms only go so far.

 

Hey, I'm willing to forgive...after of course my office mate takes his
extra anti-paranoia pills! :)
