	I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines
are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart
hardware?)

	The 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short
time, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops. It's flatly not
available -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize
it, but it's going to get a different bitstream.

	It is horribly naive to suppose that regular folks can figure
out how to crack skipjack, or clipper based telephones. I'm certainly
not devoting a great deal of thought to it.
