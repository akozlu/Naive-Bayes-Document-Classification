? = haven't looked in the archive to see if it has source or not (usually 
because I can't handle the format).  For FidoNet FREQ magic-names, the
PGPS??? names are source code, others are either execs or execs + src 
[+ extras], or in the case of NeXT, just a patch (you still need one of
the full source code packages).

NitV-BBS is FREE.  This is not an ad, it is a public service announcement.
