	[a list of large-integer arithmetic packages elided]

I thought I would note that except Lenstra's packages, none of the
large-integer packages are in the public domain. As an alternative,
a straightforward *PD* implementation of Knuth's algorithms may be
found as a part of Uof Arizona's ICON distribution.
