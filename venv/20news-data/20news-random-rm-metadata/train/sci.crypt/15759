So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It would be nice to know that they were
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the 
U.S. government.  Trusting the fox to guard the chickens, and all that.
Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.

While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  It would be a 
shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, when
all I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook the
line went dead.  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect
directly to a modem.

The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have
a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model
would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs
would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence
is not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used,
and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist.
I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a design
done in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under the
microscope.
