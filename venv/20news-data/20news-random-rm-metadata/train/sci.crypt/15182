        But that's just the problem. There is no such thing as
        "MIME-Formatted". By analogy, MIME is a content-labelling
        standard for the box, not a specification for the contents
        themselves. It provides a standard for "like-minded"
        individuals to exchange mail containing an agreed-upon data
        format.

        You say tomahto, I say tomaeto; you say postscript, I say
        SGML...
        
        Cheers,
                Marc
