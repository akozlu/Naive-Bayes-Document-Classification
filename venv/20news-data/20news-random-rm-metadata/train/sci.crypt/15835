I never advocated not saying what you believe in.  I'm advocating second
thought, and calm.  

"A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield"
"A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield"
"The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield"

Think about it.
