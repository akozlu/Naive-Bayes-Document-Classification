But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping.  The actual wiretapping will,
presumably, be conducted by the FBI.  Of course, the capability for this was
provided by the NSA, but I think that they are still within the limitations
of their charter.

I realize this is a fine point, and some may differ, but this is my opinion.
Although I don't care for Clipper and won't support or use it, I don't see
the NSA as having overstepped their bounds.
