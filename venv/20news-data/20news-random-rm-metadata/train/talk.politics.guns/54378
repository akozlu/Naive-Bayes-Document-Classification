Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people 
come out with their hands up several weeks ago.


More than someone who would not release children from the compound.

I.e., more than David Koresh/Vernon Howell/"Jesus Christ".
I saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in 
1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult.

I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair.  I think they 
bungled it badly from the start.  But I don't think they are 
responsible for the fire, which started in two different places.
