   "A handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that their
right to self-defense is of less importance than the interests of
Handgun Control, Inc.  This action comes as local, state and federal law
enforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian
compound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of one
two year old child at the hands of federal agents.  This has highlighted
the need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children
against the excesses of their own government."


  "Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a 
distortion of the facts, at best.  The aggressive outreach by officials
in central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in
the level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course, this program is
a rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an
unarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter 
restrictions."


   "The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large
who are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their
lawful affairs.  The entire country knows how vulnerable the average 
citizen is, both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our
own police.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have
shown total understanding for those innocent, law-abiding citizens on the
front lines, and the families of those who have fallen."


   "I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs
of their constituents, and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments
from ideological fanatics."

Ain't propaganda fun?
