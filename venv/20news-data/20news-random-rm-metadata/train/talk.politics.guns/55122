	What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire
	upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at
	first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they
	did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies
	do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey
	or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us,
	they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal
	wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad.
	If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply
	for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant
	then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get
	to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend
	that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction
	within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by
	US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)

	Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and
	the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and
	his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco.
	The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a
	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big
	commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be
	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the
	other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did.
	Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and
	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that
	take root.
