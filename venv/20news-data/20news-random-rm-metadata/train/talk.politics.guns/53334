I knew that Cutie would sell us out.  Full-blooded Democrat, he is :-)

Seriously folks, if it can happen here (remember?  we all got gun racks on
our 4x4s), it can happen anywhere.  Now to get that letter ready.  `Dear 
Cutie, as one who didn't vote for you, I can sincerely say I am unhappy...'



Those who know what's best for us
Must try to save us from ourselves
