It is silly to make this statement.  Fifteen minutes after the fire
started, the "official word" out of FBI  headquaters in DC was
that the DV's committed suicide.  It would seem logical that the
lantern story has more credibility.  You can't even to pretend to
know for sure what happened... although Clinton is doing just that.
