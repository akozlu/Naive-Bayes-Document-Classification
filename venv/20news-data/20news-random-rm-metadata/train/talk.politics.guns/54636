	While dedicating the Holocaust Memorial Museum, President 
Clinton remarked:

	``The evil represented in this museum is incontestable, 
but as we are its witness, so must we remain its adversary in the 
world in which we live, so we must stop the fabricators of history 
and the bullies as well."

	Clinton made this comment shortly after giving Janet Reno 
the go-ahead to hastily construct a gas chamber and crematorium
in Waco... on the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw uprising.

	Say, wasn't Monday also the anniversary of Paul Revere's ride?
Is that a clue?
