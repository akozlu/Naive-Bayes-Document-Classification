	Dont you believe that the Branch Davidians committed suicide for one
minute. I would not put it past the FBI to lob in some incendiary grenades
while they feed your their story. Don't ever ever trust what your wonderful
government tells you. Janet Reno and the FBI have the murder of a hundred
people on their hands. Hope they can sleep at night....
