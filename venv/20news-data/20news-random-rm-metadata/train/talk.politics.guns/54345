I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the
fire.  They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_
started the fire.  

                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From my understanding of the CNN report it was 6 HOURS after they started.

              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was 
first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to 
tow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.

                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
in Texas.  It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood
stove to ignite the "napalm" when the stove would probably not be in use.  And 
I doubt that it would have taken 6 hours to ignite it.

                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Right Clinton is in office.  (Sorry I couldn't resist, please no flames :))


In short Mr. Gorman (I am assuming Mr. as a title because I don't think a woman
would be stupid enough to make this post) I don't know what episode of CNN you
were watching but it obviously was not the same one that I was watching or your
tears seamed to have blured your hearing along with your eye sight.

Please excuse any mispelled words as I am a product of the Arkansas education
system which Slick Willie of the "Double Bubba Ticket" has so greately improved
during his tenour as Governer of my great state (taking it from 49th in the 
nation in 1980 and allowing it to drop to 51st, how I don't know, and bringing
it to 44st and back to either 48th or 49th in 1990--sorry I can't rember the 
source of these numbers but they can be found).
