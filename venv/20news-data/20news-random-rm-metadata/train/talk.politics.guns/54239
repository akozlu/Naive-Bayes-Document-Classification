       Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being
supposed to sign them.  I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people
an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.  

       As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would
depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is
on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  I'd say
certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who
they gave money orders out to.


       There might be some questions asked, I suppose, if somebody 
brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of "buy back"
programs.
