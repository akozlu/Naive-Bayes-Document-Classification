As quoted from <C5J5IM.3C9@cbnewsc.cb.att.com> by rats@cbnewsc.cb.att.com (Morris the Cat):

If anybody wanted proof of the nonsense of the "you can't build guns" claim,
they need look no farther than the Philippines.  Amateur gunsmiths there
regularly produce everything from .45 automatics to full auto shotguns.  Now
if this guy wants to claim that the Philippines is either technologically
superior to the US or that their transportation is better than ours, all I
can say is that he's living in a fantasy world.
