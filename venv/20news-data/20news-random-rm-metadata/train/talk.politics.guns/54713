Seriously, if you were insulted, I apologize.


People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's
no longer necessary to be an "independent thinker" to depart from the
government's party line.  It looks like our "independent press" may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is
a good sign.  I hope it continues.


Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
to challenge those "facts" critically.  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.
