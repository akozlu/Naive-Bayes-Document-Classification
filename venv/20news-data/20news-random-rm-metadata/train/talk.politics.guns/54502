	Well Josh I agree with you to some respect...less your spelling
	errors.  The Gov'mnt always must win! even if they kill every
	man women and child....by GOD they must win at all costs......

	This happens over and over and over in this country.  Lets make
	excuses, get the worthless press to cover up everything, let the
	officials take the heat for top management stupidity etc...etc...
