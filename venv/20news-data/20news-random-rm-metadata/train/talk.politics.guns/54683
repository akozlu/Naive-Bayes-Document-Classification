Isn't it ironic.  I'm of that generation, and I remember the lesson.  I
cry to see all the postings from domestic .edu sites that have naively

Especially contrasted to such a post from the .uk yet.


I suspect we saw the latter.  However, the injustice implied in letting
those involved escape without investigation and/or prosecution is also
horrible to contemplate.
