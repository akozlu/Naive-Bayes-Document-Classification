Which statement is dead wrong, because our local posters have confirmed that 
it was quite chilly that morning.


No, we argue that it was not entirely unreasonable for a woodstove to be 
operational.


Obviously you missed my earlier posting about the physica of woodstoves.
In brief, you can't turn your woodstove on and off like your gas range.
It stays on all the time.  It even stays "on" for over 24 hours AFTER you
shut it off (which is why most working woodstoves aren't ever "shut off"
until spring).
