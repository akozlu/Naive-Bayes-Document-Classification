Actually if 'a few minutes' translates into 6 hours, you have it
right.  BUT you (and I guess your single-source news agency CNN)
failed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain
view.


Well, small-scale Jim Jones type suicide with fire instead of kool-aid.


Sorry, guy, you got it wrong.  ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound.
The Branch Davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their
own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  No children survived.


Self-slaughter, anyway.  I pity the children who were to young to be able
to make a conscious choice.


You are wrong.  Thank goodness.  I would suggest, however, that you take
a deep breath, and wait 30 minutes or so before posting.  Also make sure
your facts are correct before making your allegations(sp.).


You repeated wrong.  There were 9.


God help the Branch Davidians.


NO DON'T!!!!  THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH OF THIS CRAP BEING CROSSPOSTED ALL OVER
CREATION AS IT IS!!!!!!
