Good point, Kirk.

He's still around too.  He's responded by email to a couple of my posts, 
and gosh darn, he's gotten down right civil!  This happed about the time 
he got his first firearm.  Wonder if there is a relationship here?  Turns
out that MOST people (at least the ones who are not criminals to start
with) act responsibility once given the chance.
