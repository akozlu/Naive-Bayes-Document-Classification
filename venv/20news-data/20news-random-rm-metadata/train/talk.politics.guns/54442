gassed.

But apparently true.  My opinion, only, of course.


No, it is not.  It is possible the FBI planned for this to happen, and the  
gunfire heard was the FBI keeping the folks inside.  I'm not proposing this as  
the way it went down, but just to point out that it's not "undeniable" that if  
they walked out yesterday, they would be alive today.


My heart "bleeds" for no one.  You are the "bleeding heart".  And I'm sure  
beyond any possible doubt that you do not feel for those people as I do.  You  
can not say the heartless things you have said if you did.


"they got what they wanted".  What kind of creature are you that you can  
believe this?

We agree on this.  Now lets have your God, the FBI, investigated, too.
