And why is this Freeman?  Even if a pro-gun person doesn't know what they are
talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or
two.  I am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what I have
to say.  I have several good sources of material now that I know where to look
so calm down.

Ah, Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning.  I have also
asked several of the not-so-hostile folks on this group for sources of
information to read.  Do you think, Freeman, that maybe this means I am
interested in learning?  I think it does because as you said people who don't
know anything won't be good for the pro-gun cause.

Another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freeman
and accept mistakes.  Sure, maybe it could have been some type of
misinformation being slung by some anti-gun nut but it wasn't.  I made my
statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don't worry
about it but also to learn as much as you can.  They accepted my mistake and
gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible.  I have
read several posts of yours and have found them informative.  Why don't you
give me the same chance?
