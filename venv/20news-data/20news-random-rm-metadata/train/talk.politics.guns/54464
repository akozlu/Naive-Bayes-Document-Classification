So far, there is NO credible evidence that the BD's set the fires
themselves. We only have the ATF/FBI's sayso. Law enforcements type
would *never* lie to cover their ass, right?


No, not love, just share a surprising similarity of beliefs and
method.


Funny, yeah, funny how you didn't wait for the FBI spokesdroid 
latest reversal of "facts" before proclaiming the BD's burned
themselves to death.
