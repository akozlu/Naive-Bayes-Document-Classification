Yes, the local sheriff stated that anytime he wanted to talk to Koresh, all
he had to do was call him and Koresh would come down.



Full agree with you here.  I think its ridiculous that he did not even talk
to Janet Reno until sometime Tuesday, however, he did talk with Wendell
Hubbel(?).  So who really is the Attorney General????


Hopefully the investigation will answer some of these bizarre questions.
