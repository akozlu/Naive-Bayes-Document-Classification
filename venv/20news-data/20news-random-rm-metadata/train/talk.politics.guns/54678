Well, we're not.  Which goes to prove you still don't understand what
we're saying here.


I've lived through the bombing of Cambodia; My Lai; inflated body counts
in VietNam; the funding of Noreiga; Watergate; Contragate; Chappaquiddick;
Kent State; domestic spying by the CIA; Edwin Meese's Pornography 
Commission; the War on Drugs; civil seizure; the MOVE disaster; the LA 
disaster; and now Waco.

Do you really believe that government always does what is right?


Watch the news for the next couple of months.  Watch how this whole
government-initiated debacle turns into shouting for "more gun control."
It's already started.
