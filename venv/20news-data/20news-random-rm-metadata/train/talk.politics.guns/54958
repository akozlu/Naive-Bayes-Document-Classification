	My god, a sane person!  Somebody asking intelligent questions rather
than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi
Germany.  I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF.
There are some definite questions needing answers.


	Probably.  Which is why there are so many people angry at the
initial confrontation.  Why attack a compound with as many people in that
compound who are willing to die for their leader?  Further, they attacked
in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  That
was rather stupid...


	This I doubt.  While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single
exception of the psychological "warfare" by blaring music, etc.  I think
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.


	See above...


	Agreed.


	Which is actually rather refreshing nowadays.  Most of the time, the
higher-ups claim "I don't remember..." or "I had no involvement..."  :-)
