Unworthy of comment.


Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty.
That is undeniable truth.  My heart bleeds just as much as yours for 
the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities 
to do so.  My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion 
to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up 
and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning.


I do not think this.  However, if they did set the fire (which started in 
more than one place and spread very quickly), then they got what they 
wanted and put into motion themselves.

I see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept. and likely 
by Arlen Spectre and congress.  This is good.  They have bungled the affair 
from the start.
