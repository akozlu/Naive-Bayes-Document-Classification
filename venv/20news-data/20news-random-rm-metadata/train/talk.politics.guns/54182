There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states,
such laws have been found to violate the state constitution. 
But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the
states. It was written to limit the federal government only. 
The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions
of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact
wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme
Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it
directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right
(indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the
state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that 
particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on
the Second Amendment.
