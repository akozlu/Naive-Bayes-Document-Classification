This statement simply amazes me!  "Through no fault of ATF, the element of  
surprise was lost"!  What element of surprise?  In the paragraph preceding this  
one, he said "... the special agents announced who they were and their purpose  
for being at the compound", which was to serve the federal warrant.  No element  
of surprise was even needed for that.  

No, the element of surprise that they lost was that needed for a preemptive  
first strike, without warning.  


Read: They need to wait until they see how it comes out before they fabricate  
anymore, which could get disproven.


As always, no facts, just my opinions/observations.
