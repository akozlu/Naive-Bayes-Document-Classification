I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults
and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be
deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last

           -President William Jefferson Clinton, April 20, 1993,
at a press conferance held the day after the Branch Davidians 
"compound" went up in flames while under attack by the FBI/ATF
near Waco, Texas.  Is your church U.S. Government approved?
