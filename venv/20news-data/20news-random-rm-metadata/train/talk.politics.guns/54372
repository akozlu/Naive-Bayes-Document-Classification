Hm.  A previous poster argued that the fact that the BD's did not rush to
escape the burning building indicated that it was they, and not any of the
government actions, that started the fire.  On the other hand, I wonder if,
with a face full of "massive amounts of CS," *I* would be able to escape
a burning tinder-box like that ranch house assuming my best efforts.
