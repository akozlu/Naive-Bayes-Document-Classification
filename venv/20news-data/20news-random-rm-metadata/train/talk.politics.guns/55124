OB ill-wind-and-all-that:  with Bill the Prez in there, at least the
anti-gunners are out of the closet.  The provision that any existing
so-called "assault weapons" die with their current owners was worked

in a complicated way that the anti's claimed was a "drafting error."

Can't call 'em "lying bastards" any longer.  (Not all the time ...  :-)
