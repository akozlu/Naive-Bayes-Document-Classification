I leave the anti-semitism to anti-gun types like Holly Silva.  I have in
fact been calling for the disbanding of the BATF for quite some time.
It is an outlaw agency run by incompetants who only have contempt for
the laws which they supposedly enforce.

I attribute the acts of the FBI to stupidity.  I attribute the acts of
the BATF to malice.  So did Senator Dennis DeConcini when he held
hearings about their misconduct.
