Yeah sure.  Maybe thermal GUNSIGHTS on the armored vehicles.  When
discussing military hardware and weapons, the media generally looks like
a ufology convention.


CS is merely the garden variety military teargas.  As far as it being
"humane and harmless", I've seen teenage boys knock 200lb. drill
sergeants flat getting away from it....

What do you expect when idiots and criminals confirm paranoids in their
paranoia...?
