	As a matter of fact, I know it.

	There were several shootings recently in which the guns had
been purchased at the Baltimore Gunsmith, on Broadway - a favorite
place to get cheap "popular" pieces. By "popular" I am referring to
the kinds of guns our local youth gangs like: pistol grip shotguns,
cheap magnums, and Tec-9s.

	I hate to poke a hole in your bubble, but I was referring
to a specific gunstore, and specific incidents. Any other questions?
